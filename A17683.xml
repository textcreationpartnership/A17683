            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And truly if there be any thing that firſt moued me thereto, the ignoraunce together with the vanitie of many of our own people was one, who being vtterly vnskilfull of God and godlines, do yet apply their myndes to the vaine delightes of this flattering world, quite forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

We haue right honorable in many places the tables and tennis in ſteede of the Teſtament, the cardes in ſteede of the Catechiſme, the boules in ſteede of the Bible: yea and that more is, men think they haue made a very good change. We ſee ſome men beſtowe their time in writing, ſome in printing, and mo men in
<pb facs="tcp:10157:3"/>
reading of vile &amp; blaſphemous, or at leſt of prophan &amp; friuolous bokes, ſuch as are that infamous lege<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of K. Arthur (which with ſhame inough I heare to be new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imprinted) with the horrible actes of thoſe whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters, Launcelot du Lake, Triſtram de Liones, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of Orkney, Merlin, the lady of the Lake, with the vile and ſtinking ſtory of the Sangreal, of king Peleus, &amp;c. ſome agayn ſtudy the liues of Huon of Burdeaux, and king Oberon, the king of the Fairies, of Valentine and Orſon, and the lady Cleremond, with the Iuggler Paccolet and king Trumpert, and the giant Ferragus: and the liues of the foure ſonnes of Aymon, with the worthy actes of Oliuer and Rouland, Guichard and Richard: ſome are expert in Beuis of Hampton that notable man, with the death of Boniface, Arundel and Trunchifice: ſome in the court of Venus, ſome in the Ieſtes of Skoggen the kinges dizzard: ſome in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleties of Howleglas, and Garagantua: ſome agayne (and to many) in the peſtilent pollicies of that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound Matchiauile: in the puddle of pleaſure, and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt of hiſtories, and ſuch like, which doe manifeſtly ſhew that gods word is either ſhamefully neglected, or deſpitefully condemned. For if any good booke be writen, it lieth in the printers handes, ſmally regarded, ſeldome enquired after: ſo that the printer is ſcarce pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the paper that goeth to the booke. And this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth many printers which ſeeketh after gaynes, to take in hande rather thoſe thinges that are profitable to the purſe (though thei be ridiculous) &amp; ſo ſatiſfie mens hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, then to printe without profite thoſe bookes that

It could not therefore but grieue me, to ſee thoſe enemies of mankinde, the World, Death, and Hell, ſo preuaile by their flattering illuſions, that they haue drawen after them the moſt parte of the people at this day, yea and ſought in time paſt, euen in my yongeſt yeres, to haue taken me in thoſe their nettes together for company. Whereupon,<note place="margin">Ephe. 6.</note> I determined amongeſt others, to geue them one blow more with the ſword of the ſpirit, the word of God, according to my duty, calling, &amp; profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on, and to ring the Alarum bel together, with al godly preachers, vnto our ſleepie country men, aduertiſing them of the approching of our deadly foes long agoe deſcried by the ſermons and writinges of the Martirs. Once before this time I attempted by mine own booke lately publiſhed, to abandone the ſecuritie of this our nation: the Lord graunt that it hath any thing awaked them. But now the ſecond tyme I haue cauſed that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Doctor of the Church, <hi>Iohn Caluine,</hi> the Lordes vigilant watchman, euen in our owne tongue to ſound the trumpe, if by this meanes eyther he or I may geue them warning before their fall, to eſchew theſe baytes of wily Sathan, who knoweth whether the Lorde by this meanes wil open the eyes of ſome men to ſee their owne ſinnes and to be ſory for the ſame? But if they be neuer the better, but rather the blynder, my conſcience is diſcharged, and theſe few lines ſhalbe vnto their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences a witneſſe, that they are from henceforth with out excuſe before the throne of God: And I feare there

                        </gap>a</hi> at the laſt day, then for them. For in this diſcourſe they might ſee:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the ſinnes of Niniueh, and in it their own ſinnes. 2 Againe, the mercy of God in ſending <hi>Ionas</hi> vnto the <hi>Niniuites,</hi> being haynous offenders, and thereby ſee that the Lord is alſo mercifull vnto themſelues, that he warneth them of their fall by his preachers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Then the diſobedience of <hi>Ionas</hi> and his puniſhment,<note place="margin">To what end God puniſheth his Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> and thereby may they ſee a liuely image of the fall of Gods children vnto ſinne, and Gods iuſtice euen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſeruauntes, to the ende to reclaime them, and not to condemne them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Alſo they might ſee here the working of gods ſpirite in <hi>Ionas,</hi> being in the bottom of the ſea, and his deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and thereby might they learne, that God by puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing his ſeruantes, maketh them more ſtrong, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their faith, and when they cry vnto him, he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them out of all their troubles.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 And ſo agayne might they ſee how ſeuerely <hi>Ionas</hi> preached vnto the <hi>Niniuites,</hi> (hauing no commiſſion to entreat of Gods mercy vnto them) and yet that kind of preaching wrought in them repentaunce, beyng the very ende why God ſent <hi>Ionas</hi> vnto them (although <hi>Ionas</hi> conſidered it not) and alſo gods mercy in pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their ſinnes. And by this might they learne, that though God ſpeake angerly vnto vs, yet he neuer ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſo, but for our profit, and will ſurely pardon our iniquities, if we from the hart repent vs of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10157:5"/>Laſtly they might ſee how Ionas beyng once forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, yet eftſoone offended more grieuously, yea, and murmured agaynſt God, and yet God vanquiſhed him with reaſon, and of his great mercy forgaue him alſo that his ſinne. And by this might they learn how fraile the children of God are, if they be not ſtill gouerned by gods ſpirite, and how mercifull God is vnto thoſe that be his, with many other things moſt neceſſary for all men. If they therefore neglect or contemne theſe things, let them know that they neglect the very word of the lord and their ſaluation, and ſo purchaſe to them ſelues eternall death. The lord therefore for his mercy ſake, heale their blinde eyes, and helpe their vnbeliefe. Now right honorable, if I be asked what mooued me to dedicate theſe my labours vnto you: I muſt needes anſwer that the ſweete and comfortable matter therein conteyned, (whereof I know your honour will be a willing partaker) and the good liking that you haue had alwayes of M.

but <hi>Ionas</hi> ſignifieth that he was called from his accuſtomed office, and a new prophecie enioyned him. viz: that he might deuounce vnto the <hi>Nineuites</hi> their deſtruction euen at hande, as hereafter we ſhall perceyue.

when he was ſent to <hi>Nineueh,</hi> but when he was an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Prophet, the Lorde woulde alſo tranſferre his labour to other Nations. But that he was ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto <hi>Nineueh:</hi> it might be that the Lord, werie of the obſtinacie of his owne people, woulde ſhewe an example of godlie docilitie, in a prophane and incircumciſed Nation, whereby he might make the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites the more inexcuſable. They outwardlie gaue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to true pietie: they boſted that they were a holy people. Circumciſion was vnto them a token and pledge of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt of God: yet deſpiſed they all the Prophetes, that teaching with them might be vnprofitable. It is therfore propable, that the Prophete was taken awaye from them, that the <hi>Nineuites</hi> with their example might augment the crime of the people of Iſrael, for that in thrée dayes they were conuerted vnto God, after that <hi>Ionas</hi> preached there. But with the Iſraelites and their Gentiles, nothing long tyme he profited, when as yet ſufficientlie was his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie eſtabliſhed, and that vnto their profite as we haue ſayd of late. For <hi>Ionas</hi> prophecied that the kingdome of Iſrael as yet ſhoulde continue: although they were worthy to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe, the Lorde yet performed that which he had ſpoken by the mouth of his ſeruaunt. They ought therefore to haue embraced his doctrine, not onely becauſe it was of God, but alſo becauſe the Lorde woulde haue it to be amiable vnto them. And I truelie doo not doubte but that the ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the people by this meanes was increaſed, ſéeing that the <hi>Nineuits</hi> repented at the voyce of <hi>Ionas,</hi> and that in ſhort tyme: but the Iſraelites alwayes continued hardened in their ſtubbornneſſe. And therefore certaine men more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly then wyſelie, doo expounde this place of <hi>Math.</hi> 12. This peruerſe generation ſéeketh a ſigne, and there ſhall no ſygne be geuen vnto it, but the ſigne of the Prophete <hi>Ionas:</hi> thus they ſaye, that the Goſpel ſhoulde be tranſported vnto the Gentiles, euen as <hi>Ionas</hi> was ledde awaye from his owne Nation, and geuen a Teacher vnto forraine and prophane
<pb facs="tcp:10157:11"/>
Nations. And vnder that they wyll haue to lye hidden the calling of the Gentiles many yéeres to come: as if Chriſte ſayde that he woulde after come to the Gentiles, when he had proued the deſperate wickedneſſe of his elected people. But becauſe Chriſte plainelie applyeth the ſimylitude: it is not our parte this way or that way, to drawe his wordes. And he reſtraineth the figure to this one ſence, that is: euen as <hi>Ionas,</hi> was thrée dayes in the bellye of the Whale: ſo muſt hee be three dayes in the bowels of the earth, as if he ſhould ſaye, that in this he wyll be lyke vnto <hi>Ionas,</hi> becauſe he ſhalbe a reuiued Prophete. And this thing ſayde Ieſus aduiſedlie, becauſe he perceyued both him ſelfe to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempned of the Iewes, and his labour vnto them to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. Seeing that at this time nowe you geue no eare vnto mée, neither get I among you any eſtimation, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after wyll I be a newe Prophete, that is: after the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, ſo then wyl I beginne to ſpeake more effectuouſly, aſwell with the Iewes, as with the Gentyles, euen as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> conuerted <hi>Nineueh,</hi> when he was returned to lyfe. This is therefore the plaine meaning of this place: Therefore was not <hi>Ionas</hi> a figure of Chriſt for that he was ſent away vnto the Gentiles, but becauſe after thrée dayes he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued, when he was in a maner a dead man. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it be we ſee that <hi>Ionas</hi> is appointed a Teacher to the <hi>Nineuits,</hi> after that ſome whyle he had exerciſed the office of a Prophete among the people of Iſrael. They which ſaye that then was made a ſhewe of the calling of the Gentiles, yet to come, they bring ſome thing plauſible, or to be borne with: but they ſeeme not to vſe ſounde reaſon, for this was an extraordinarye thinge. Therefore not as yet did God manifeſtly ſhewe, what thing hee woulde doo by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſte:<note place="margin">2. King. 5. ver. 15.</note> Euen as when <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> was conuerted vnto the faith, and a fewe others, God then alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nothing in the accuſtomed order. For alwayes there was a ſpeciall calling of the generation of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10157:11"/>
alwayes Religion was ſhut vp within his auncient bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds:<note place="margin">Pſal. 147. ver. <hi>20.</hi>
                           </note> and alwayes this was certaine that God dealt not ſo with other Nations, as with the Iewes, becauſe he reuealed not vnto them his iudgements. God therefore vntyll the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſte would haue the adoption of the generation of <hi>Abraham</hi> continew fyrme and ſure, ſo that the Iewes might excell, aboue all other people, and might differ in this frée priueledge or prerogatiue, that they might be a people holie and elect. But the Authors contrarie opinion, doo ſaye, that the <hi>Nineuits</hi> were turned vnto the Lorde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cyrcumciſion: that is true, but I knowe not whether their conuerſion were true and right, of the which mention ſhal be made hereafter: and then of that matter I wyl, God-wylling, more at large entreate. But this ſéemeth rather probable, that the <hi>Nineuits</hi> were ſo touched with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes and threatninges of the Prophete, that humbly they beſought God to auerte his indignation. God then once forgaue them: what after came to paſſe it euidently appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not. Truely, it is not lykelie that all the whole Citie was conuerted vnto God. For immediatlie after, that Cttie was verie hurtful, aſwel to the Iſraelites, as to the Iewes, and with continuall deſtructions, was the Church of God afflicted by the <hi>Nineuits:</hi> and ſéeing it is ſo certainely, it wanteth all likelyhood or coulor of trueth, that they truelie repented from the harte. But the full diſcourſe of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I leaue to another place.</p>
                        <p>Let vs goe forwarde nowe in the texte. <hi>Ariſe, goe to Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neueh into that great Citie. <hi>Nineueh</hi>

might fortifie their fayth, when they perceyued that the Lorde had not altogether reiected them, but that hee once woulde reuenge their iniuries. The care of <hi>Ionas</hi> was otherwiſe.

And this ought to haue bene of great force to haue anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Ionas,</hi> euen for that he dealt not with the <hi>Nineuits</hi> as a man, but as the meſſenger of God. And this alſo might bende their hartes, that they might vnderſtande, although no mortall man coulde puniſhe their wickedneſſe, yet that they coulde not eſcape the vengeaunce of God.

Neyther is it any doubte, but that he was not onely of a troubled minde, but plainelie aſtonied, when he vndertooke ſuch a deuiſe.</p>
                        <p>The queſtion is, why <hi>Ionas</hi> ſo fled from the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. The Iewes, as they couldlie tryfle in matters Diuine, ſaye that he feared, if he ſhoulde come to <hi>Nineueh,</hi> that he ſhoulde be deſtitute of the ſpirite of prophecie: as though the lyke daunger were not, if he paſſed the Seas: this is to friuolous and chyldiſhe. And againe they fayne a matter of no weyght or importaunce, ſéeing other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons waighty inough, doo yéelde them ſelues of their owne accorde vnto vs. For this was ſtraunge and vnaccuſtomed, the Prophete to be taken awaye from the elect people, and ſent to prophane Nations. When <hi>Peter</hi> was ſent to <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">

What therefore might come in minde to <hi>Ionas?</hi> if onelie for one man, the minde of <hi>Peter</hi> was ſo quayled, that be thought it to be a phantaſie, where he was ſent to be a teacher to <hi>Cornelius:</hi> when <hi>Ionas</hi> was ſent to <hi>Nineueh,</hi> to a Citie ſo populous, what might he thinke with him ſelf? Therefore the noueltie of the matter without doubt might greatlie ſhake the minde of the holye Prophete, and make him, that voyde of counſayle, he might flée or conueigh him ſelfe elſe whether. This thing alſo diſtruſt might cauſe. For what hope had he, that that people coulde be conuerted, which dyd euen triumphe in the lycenciouſneſſe thereof. For he had fyrſt tryed the hardneſſe of the elected people: he was faithfully occupied in doing of his duetie: he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted nothing whereby he might eſtabliſh the worſhip
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10157:14"/>
of God and true pietie in the people of Iſrael: but profited lytle: and yet the Iewes were called euen from the wombe. What then might he looke for, when the Lorde tooke him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye to the <hi>Nineuits?</hi> For there raigned vnbrydled laſciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and then was there extreame blindneſſe: they had not at any tyme any taſte of the worſhipping of God. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, they were drowned in profounde darkneſſe, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell raigned by all meanes, there. This diſtruſt therefore might vexe or breake the minde of <hi>Ionas,</hi> that he obeyed not the commaundement of God. The imbecilitie or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the fleſhe might alſo hinder him, whereby he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed not his lawful calling. He might reaſon thus? what? truelie I ſhall come into the principall ſeate of that Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, which this daye treadeth all the earth vnder féete: I being a contemned and obſcure: and moreouer ſhall bring a meſſage full of hatred, which immediatlie ſhall ſtyrre vp the mindes of men vnto furie. What ſhall I ſaye to the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuits?</hi> you are wicked men: God can no longer ſuffer your impietie: therefore horrible vengeaunce is at hande vnto you. Howe ſhall I be entertayned? Therefore <hi>Ionas</hi> might, being as yet enuironed with the infirmities of the fleſhe, conceyue feare in his minde, which might caſt awaye, or ſhake off from him the affection of obedience. And I doubt not for my parte, but <hi>Ionas</hi> pondered all theſe thinges with him ſelfe: for he was not lyke a blocke. And this is not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous as I ſayde before, that he declared that Citie to be greate. God truely was wylling to remoue the offence: but <hi>Ionas</hi> argueth on the contrarie part; I ſee ſharpe warre ſhall come vppon mée, yea an heape of troubles to inuade mee, which an hundred tymes myght ouerwhelme mée: when the Lorde not in vayne foretolde him of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Citie. And although he might conceyue hope, if they were rebuked that they woulde yéelde due honour vnto God, yet he confeſſeth that this commeth as a let into his minde, that he ſhoulde not goe forewarde in the courſe of
<pb facs="tcp:10157:15"/>
his calling. Therefore aſwell diſtruſt, as feare of the fleſh, dyd delay or ſtay <hi>Ionas:</hi> and that noueltie or ſtraungeneſſe, might euen as I haue ſayde already, moue him, that he had rather as it were enter the graue, then to vndertake that office,<note place="margin">God Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to our reaſon, but he knoweth before to what ende.</note> which in a manner was voyde of all reaſon. For to what ende are the Prophetes ſent, but that they might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite ſomwhat by their labour, and might reape ſome fruite: but <hi>Ionas</hi> hoped for no ſuch thing. Moreouer, to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes is geuen ſome authoritie, or at the leaſt ſome lyber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to teache. But <hi>Ionas</hi> thought that al wayes to enter were ſhut from him. And further, <hi>Ionas</hi> thought that this was contrarie to the couenaunt of the Lorde. For he had choſen one only people to him ſelfe: and nowe <hi>Ionas</hi> thought that he was as it were tyed to one ſtake, when he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned a Teacher in his owne countrey. He coulde not therfore be taken thence to another place, but he felt in him ſelfe great reſiſtaunce.

But what is it to free from the face of the Lord, but that hée heere confeſſeth, that he fled from the preſence of God as though hee deſired, as fugitiue ſeruaunts are accuſtomed, to reiecte the rule and impery of his God?

It is no doubte, but <hi>Ionas</hi> by playne wordes expreſſeth, not onely that he was a fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: but alſo that he was ſo by diuers meanes. Nowe as much toucheth the flyght, dyligently that is to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked which I haue ſpoke before: that they flée from the ſyght of God, whoſoeuer doo not wyllinglie obey his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes: not that they can depart farre away from him, but that aſmuch as in them lyeth, they wyl ſhut vp God in certayne ſtrayghtes or narrowe places, and ſo exempt them ſelues from his power and hande.

But that <hi>Ionas</hi> made none accounte of theſe things, yea that ſluggiſhely hée lyeth, whence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth ſo great negligence, but that not only hée was in a dead ſleepe, but that he ſéemeth depriued both of all reaſon and ſence? it is no doubt therefore but <hi>Ionas</hi> for this reſpecte reckneth vp ſo many circumſtaunces, he ſayth, <hi>The shipmen feared,</hi> and we knowe that Marriners are not accuſtomed to bee terrified with ſmall and vſuall ſtormes: for they are a hard kinde of men: and are the leſſe fearefull for that they dayly ſee diuerſe motions in the ayre. When as therefore he ſayth, that the ſhypmen feared: here hence we gather that it was no meane tempeſt, which ſo terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, being men by long vſe and experience accuſtomed to all kinde of ſtormes. Well, they then which before were hardned, were nowe ſtroken with feare. After that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that, <hi>Euerie one cried vnto his God. <hi>Ionas</hi>
                           </hi> certainly ſhould not haue ſlept ſo ſoundly, but might haue waked himſelfe almoſt euery moment. For hée carried in his hart his owne tormentour, when he perceiued himſelfe to be a fugitiue. For we haue ſpoken before, that it was no light offence, that <hi>Ionas</hi> conueighed himſelf from the face of God, contempned his callinge, and as much as in him laye, caſte of the yoke, that he would not obay God. When as therefore <hi>Ionas</hi> of ſo great wickedneſſe was guilty in his owne minde: ought hée not being a ſléepe to tremble &amp; feare? And again, while other

But Religion, which was eyther well wye extincted, or at the leaſt ouerwhelmed in the hartes of men, is rayſed and ſtyrred vp by daungers. Of this matter <hi>Ionas</hi> bringeth for the notable example, when he ſayth: <hi>That the Shipmen cried vnto their Gods.</hi> We knowe howe rude that kind of men be: therfore gladly would they driue from them ſelues all féeling of gladneſſe: and in verie déede they ſhiftes of all feare, and mocke euen God him ſelfe, as long as they maye. That they therefore crye vnto the Gods: certainely, verie vrgent neceſſitie extorted this at their handes. And hereby gather we howe profitable it is for vs to be diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by feare: becauſe if we were in ſafetie, immediatlie a dead ſtéeple woulde réepe vpon vs, as it is too well, or more
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10157:19"/>
then inough knowne. And ſéeing that no man almoſt of his owne accorde commeth to God, we haue néede of prickings forwarde. But God earneſtlie or ſharplie pricketh vs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, when he layeth any daungers againſt vs, whereby we are conſtrained to feare. But by this meanes, as I haue already ſayde, doth he ſolycite vs, becauſe that we ſée euerie one to wander and to vaniſhe awaye in their luſkiſhneſſe: therefore draweth he backe vnwylling men vnto him.</p>
                        <p>But <hi>Ionas</hi> ſayth not ſimply, that each man cryed vnto God, but alſo addeth, <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto his God.</hi> Euen as therefore this place teacheth, that by neceſſitie men are conſtrayned to ſéeke God: ſo alſo on the other ſide he ſheweth that the ſame men, vnleſſe they be gouerned by the celeſtiall doctrine, and then alſo by the ſpirite of God, doo erre in the ſéeking of God. There ſhall be therefore in men a certaine ſtudy, but it ſhall be erroneous, becauſe no man can kéepe the right waye, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Lorde dyrect them by his worde and ſpirite, as is aforeſayde. Both theſe thinges doo we gather out of the wordes of the Prophete. <hi>The Shipmen feared,</hi> being rough fellowes, and almoſt as harde as yron, which lyke a <hi>Cyclop</hi> tontempne God, <hi>They feared</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>and cried vnto God:</hi> but they cryed not, hauing faith for their directrix or guide, and hence came it to paſſe that each man cryed to his owne God. When we reade this, let vs firſt of all conſider, that we ought not to wayte, tyll God violentlie conſtraine vs, but muſt preuent this laſt extremitie that we of our owne accorde maye ſéeke him. For what profited it theſe Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners or other Saylers, that once they cryed vnto God? for it is cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:10157:20"/>
euen whyle we be out of daunger, and doo enioye chiefeſt quietneſſe. For if we imagin that any pretence of vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe, or of error, or folly maye be obiected of vs, we are farre deceyued, becauſe no excuſe ſhalbe admitted, ſéeing that experience doeth teache that the knowledge of God is naturally grafted: and againe, this principle to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen in all men, that God gouerneth our lyfe, that he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maye delyuer vs from death, that it is his proper office to ſuccour vs and to helpe vs. For how can it come to paſſe that theſe Marriners cryed vnto God? Came there thyther any new Teacher which might preache vnto them of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes, and which in order might ſhewe God to be the dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerer of mankinde? No verely: But already this thing, as I haue ſayde, by nature was imprinted in their hartes.</p>
                        <p>The Sea being calme, none of them called vpon God: but euen verie daunger chaſeth awaye this drowſineſſe from them. By this it ſufficientlie appeareth, whatſoeuer excuſe they take which vnto God yéelde not his glorie, that the ſame ſhalbe friuolous and vaine, becauſe there néedeth not any lawe, there is no néede of Scriptures, there is no néede finally, of any doctrine, that men maye perceyue their lyfe to be in the hande of God, that ſaluation of him onely is to be required, as we haue already ſayde. For inuocation it ſelfe, beareth recorde that men are ſo perſwaded of God. For inuocation or calling vpon, commeth not from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, then from a certaine ſecrete inſtinct, &amp; thervnto nature being truely guide &amp; maiſtreſſe. This is one thing. But in the meane tyme alſo wée maye learne out of this place, that ſo often as God is to be ſought of vs, we muſt not truſt to our owne wytte, becauſe we ſhall immediatlie erre. God therefore is to be deſyred, that he gouerne vs with his worde, for otherwyſe all men ſhall flowe headlong to their owne ſuperſtitions, euen as we ſée here euerie man to crye to his peculiar God.</p>
                        <p>And further the Prophet admoniſheth here, that the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10157:20"/>
of Gods was not hatched of late. For alwayes men were prone to lying and vanitie after the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> we know what great corruption poſſeſſeth our mindes, ſo that euery one faygneth to him ſelfe horrible wonders. Séeing it is ſo, it is no maruayle that ſuperſtitions haue alwayes raunged in the worlde, becauſe the wytte of man is the workehouſe of all errors. And herehence againe we may gather that which I touched of late, that nothing is more wicked, then to folowe the motions of our fleſhe, becauſe euerie one wyll caſt him ſelfe further into error, yea with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any impulſion of others, and ſometime one drawe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, euen as it is cuſtomably ſéene. Nowe he addeth that: <hi>The veſſelles were caſt forth.</hi> That is, the loadings of the ſhyp, according as we ſée this to be the laſt refuge in ſhypwracks, euen that men for lyfe ſake doo wyllingly ſpoyle themſelues of al theyr ritches, and here alſo we ſée howe precious mans lyfe is to him, which ſticketh not to ſtrip him ſelfe naked of all his goodes, leaſt he ſhoulde periſhe. Truely we flée po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, and many purchaſe death vnto them ſelues, becauſe pouerty is vnto them intollerable. But, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they come into ſome extreame daunger, alwayes men preferre their owne lyues before all their rytches. For what are all the goodes of this worlde, but euen a certaine accident to our lyfe? But <hi>Ionas</hi> to another purpoſe declareth the Shyp to be vnburde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, euen that we maye knowe that this was no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tempeſt, but when the Shipmen were euen at deathes doore, they vſed this laſt remedie. Nowe foloweth that other member, which is: that <hi>Ionas deſcended into the ſides of the Shippe,</hi> or ſyde, and <hi>Laie downe and ſlept.</hi> There is no doubte but that <hi>Ionas</hi> ſought ſome ſecréete place before the tempeſt roſe: When as therefore they loſed from the Hauen <hi>Ionas</hi> departed into ſome ſecréete corner, that he might ſléepe there. But this ſecuritie in him was not excuſable, for when he knew him ſelfe to be a fugitiue from the face of the Lorde, he ought therfore to haue bene toſſed with continual
<pb facs="tcp:10157:21"/>
terrors: yea, he himſelfe ought to haue bene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exact or of his own care. But euen ſo it ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times falleth out when a man hath gotten ſquylking hooles, that at the length he induceth vpon him ſelfe almoſte a brutiſhe aſtoniſhment, he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vpon nothing, he careth for nothing, he is troubled with nothing.</p>
                        <p>Such a luſkiſhneſſe therfore had inuaded the mynde of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> when he went downe into ſome ſecret place of the ſhipe, that there he might geue himſelfe to ſléepe. But if this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the holy Prophet, which of vs may not feare his owne ſtate? Therefore let vs learne often tymes to call backe our ſelues to the iudgement ſeate, and when our mindes are withhoulden or occupied with ſléepe, let vs learne to ſtirre our ſelues vppe, and to take account of our ſelues, leaſt the iudgement of the Lorde doo ouerwhelme vs being a ſléepe. For what letted why that this ruine might not altogether haue drowned <hi>Ionas,</hi> but that the Lord piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſeruaunt: and watched and prouided for the ſauegard of him ſleeping? except therefore the Lorde had taken ſuch care for <hi>Ionas,</hi> his ende had bene come, we ſée therefore how oftentymes the Lorde reſpecteth his people, whyle hée is of them nothing regarded, and taketh continual watch, while they ſléepe. But this ought not to ſtand in force to nouriſh our licenciouſe libertie: for euery one of vs flattereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf now more then inough, but rather while we ſée <hi>Ionas</hi> to haue bene ſo nye to his finall deſtruction<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When he ſayth, <hi>Yf peraduenture,</hi> we haue ſeene already that the holy ghoſt vſeth this phraſe: although there is no doubt, but that onely difficultie is noted. Here notwithſtanding is it probable that the Shipmaiſter was, as prophane men are wont, perplexed and doubtfull, and coulde determine nothing certainly of the ayde of God. Therefore whyle he thus wauered in minde, he ſayth that all remedies are to be tryed. And here as it were in a glaſſe maye we ſée, howe wretched is the eſtate of all thoſe, which call not vpon God with a certaine and ſure fayth: they crye truely vnto God, becauſe the knowledge of Nature enforceth them thereto: But they knowe not whether by theyr crying they profite any thing or no, they do repete their prayers, but they know not whether their wordes vaniſh away in the ayre, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they come vnto God.

                           <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue ſayde in our reading yeſterdaye, that this was a ſigne of extreme feare, that the Mariners and the reſt caſt lottes, becauſe this is not wonte to be done, but where men perceyue, them ſelues deſtitute both of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and counſayle. But this is alſo to be noted, that wheras they caſt lottes, it procéedeth of error; becauſe they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge not, that if the Lord would take vengaunce of euery of them, that they them ſelues were alſo worthy of greater puniſhment. For they would not haue layde the fault vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon one mans ſhoulders, if euery man had well conſidered what he had deſerued before God. Nowe if any calamitie happen, it is the duetie of euerie man to examine him ſelfe, and his lyfe before God: ſo ſhall it come to paſſe, that from the firſt to the laſt, they all muſt confeſſe, that they ſuffer iuſt puniſhment. But whyle al men together enquire which of them is guyltie before God, ſo doo they exonerate them ſelues, as if they were innocent. And this diſeaſe alſo at this daye doeth raunge in the worlde, euen that wyllingly eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man layeth the faulte vpon others, and wyll all ſéeme innocent before God: Not that they maye aboliſhe all their guiltineſſe, but becauſe euerie one extenuate their offences, as if iuſtlie God ſo ſeuerely might not perſecute them: For examples ſake. If a man perceyue that he hath offended diuerſe ways he wyll certainely confeſſe, with one worde, that he is a ſinner. But if any man ſhal recken vp and bring to light all his offences hée wyll ſaye: this is a light ſinne, this is a veniall ſinne, and the Lorde dealeth with vs not according to good right, that he will bring vs immediately to extréeme puniſhment. If we offende lightly, this ſtraight way, commeth in minde vnto vs. So did the Shipmen, of whome <hi>Ionas</hi> here ſpeaketh. If a man had demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, whether they were altogether without faulte, euery man had confeſſed, that he had bene before God an offender: but in the meane tyme they caſt lottes, as if one man onely
<pb facs="tcp:10157:25"/>
had bene ſubiect to the iudgement of God, and why ſo? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, euen becauſe they imagined that their offences deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not ſo gréeuous puniſhment. Howſoeuer therefore they offended, and be conuicted, &amp; perceyue this thing certainly, yet ſo great matter make they not of their ſinnes, that they thinke them ſelues to haue deſerued any ſuch puniſhment. This therefore is the reaſon why they fall vnto lottes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter came to that tryal, euery man thought himſelfe innocent. This place declareth, which thing alſo euen by common experience is to wel knowen, that men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they perceyue them ſelues guilty before God, doo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate their ſinnes, and promiſe pardon to them ſelues, as though they coulde indent with God, that hée ſhoulde not deale with them by extremitie, but fauorably ſhould handle them. Hearehence therefore ſpringeth hope to eſcape with out puniſhment, for as muche as of moſt gréeuouſe ſinnes wée make but light offence. So ſée we in the papacye that diuers meanes haue bene immagined, whereby they might obſolue themſelues, &amp; wype away their ſpots, in the preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God. The ſprinkling of holy water putteth away almoſt all ſinnes, except a man be adulterer, an homicide, a ſorcerer or ten tymes pariured, he thinketh himſelfe not culpable of any cryme, therefore the ſacrifices which they vſe, are of force, they thinke to blotte out al iniquityes: Whence ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth this errour. Euen becauſe they eſtéeme of God by theyr owne wittes, and thinke not their ſinnes to be ſo great an abhomination in the ſight of God. But this is no newe thing. For we ſée what nowe happened in the tyme of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas:</hi> and out of prophane hiſtories we may gather this error then euery where to haue occupied the myndes of all men: they had theyr dayly ſacrifices, euen as the Papiſts haue their Maſſes, their Pilgrimages, their holy water ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynges, and lyke tryfles. But euen as in the Papacie there be certaine caſes reſerued, ſo alſo if any man had ſlayne ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Father or mother, if a man had committed inceſt, hée
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10157:25"/>
had néede of an extraordinary ſacrifice: and if any were of a notable vertue vpon earth, him they vſe, that they might ſéeke a newe kinde of Sacrifice, here is an example of this errour layde before vs, when as they ſaye: <hi>Let vs caſt lette<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For here muſt one man be wicked: but no man will come forth in preſence with this tytle, and therefore caſt they lottes.</p>
                        <p>Now ryſeth a queſtion, whether this was a lawful meane to fynde out the truth: whether, when they were ignoraunt for whoſe offence the tempeſt aroſe, it were lawfull to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Certaine men haue bene too ſuperſtitious in the condempning of lottes, becauſe preciſely they affirmed all lottes to be wicked: From hence was the name geuen to the Lot prophetes, and they thought that theſe Diuiners by lotte differed lytle from Magicians and Inchaunters. But this thing tooke his beginning of error, becauſe we knowe that it was at ſome tyme permitted to caſt the lotte. And <hi>Salomon</hi> truely, as it were of a politike order ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">Pro. 16.33</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſayth: The lottes are caſt into the lappe, but the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof is of the Lorde. <hi>Salomon</hi> there ſpeaketh not in that place of artes Magicall, but ſayth, when the lottes are put in, they come not forth by chaunce, but by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God.<note place="margin">

And again, the holy ghoſt had a ſtroke in the election. There is therefore no doubt, but that God allowed of that lotte. Euen as alſo when <hi>Ioſua</hi> tryed out the matter by lotte,<note place="margin">

                              <desc>•</desc>

<pb facs="tcp:10157:26"/>
his ſacriledge. No man dare condempne that lotte. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſufficientlie appeareth that which I haue ſayde, that they were ſuperſtitious, which without any exception con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned all kinde of lottes. But this is with all to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that confuſedly, or without any difference, lottes are not to be vſed.</p>
                        <p>It is a part of politicke order: If any heritage be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, when deuiſion is made, it ſhalbe lawful in that caſe to caſt lottes: becauſe it neyther lyeth in the one nor other to chuſe, let euerie man take the parte which falleth vnto him by lotte. So alſo it is lawfull of Prouinces to caſt lotte, where men are ſent any whether: and if they deuide the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours betwéene them, leaſt any enuy ſhould ariſe, where as euerie man woulde drawe ſome parte to him ſelfe, in that caſe, Lottes take away all ſtryfes. Such kinde of caſting lottes is as well by the worde of God, as by the lawes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytted. But if any man without any cauſe wyll caſte lottes, the ſame ſhalbe ſuperſtitious, &amp; ſhall not much differ from a Magicien or Inchaunter. For example ſake. If any man woulde take a iourney, or goe about any other thing, if he caſt into the cappe two lottes, a whyte and a blacke, ſaying, I wyl ſée whether this iourney ſhalbe this day, proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous or no, that dealing is deuiliſhe, euen as Sathan with ſuch deceiptes deludeth myſerable men.</p>
                        <p>Therefore if any man without cauſe would deale by lotte, this thing as I haue alreadye ſayde is voyde of all excuſe. But as much as toucheth other lottes, ſuch as this whereof we nowe intreate, that ought not to be brought for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample which is mentioned in ſome other place. For if <hi>Ioſua</hi> caſt lottes, to the intent to make euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for what cauſe God was angrie with his people, it is not lawfull to immitate that facte: for that it is not to be doubted, but that <hi>Ioſua</hi> by a peculiar inſtincte was admoniſhed, that he ſhould caſt lotts. So alſo when <hi>Saule</hi> caſt lottes,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.40.</note> and then was his ſonne <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi> deprehended and found out which had taffed honny,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:10157:26"/>
this was a particular example. The ſame thing alſo is of this lotte to be ſpoken. For becauſe the Mariners were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayde, neyther fynde they for what cauſe the tempeſte hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and the feare of ſhipwracke had inuaded them, they flée vnto the lotte if we will immitate this thing dayly, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely ſo great liberty pleaſeth not God, neither is it agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his word. Therefore it is to be houlden, that there were certaine peculiar inſtinctes, when as the ſeruauntes of God vſed lottes in doubtfull and extreme matters. Let this therefore in fewe wordes be an aunſwere to that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether it were lawfull for the ſhipmen to caſt lottes, that they might finde out for whoſe cauſe they were ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daungered.

There is no doubte therefore, but that <hi>Ionas</hi> plainlie confeſſed his fault, although he mencioneth not the ſame. But we know that this maner of ſpeaking is much vſed among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebrewes, euen that they place that laſt which fyrſte was to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of: and the <hi>Grammarians</hi> call that, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>When as therefore <hi>Ionas</hi> ſayeth that he is an Hebrew, and the worſhipper of the true God, this rather tendeth to the aggrauation of the crime or offence: then to any prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or coulor of excuſation. For if he had ſimplie ſaide that he had bene guyltie in his owne ſight, becauſe he was not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient vnto God, the offence had not bene ſo heynous. But when he maketh his preface, that the true God, the maker of heauen and earth, was knowne vnto him, euen the God of Iſrael, which manifeſted him ſelfe, his lawe being geuen and publiſhed: when as therefore thus <hi>Ionas</hi> maketh his preface, therein taketh he awaye from him ſelfe all coulors or excuſes of ignoraunce, or error. He was trayned vp in the lawe, and from a chylde had learned who was the true God. He coulde not therefore fall by error, he alſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped not counterfeyte Gods, as dyd the other men, and he was an Iſraelite. Séeing then he was inſtructed in true godlyneſſe, his offence was the more grieuous, when he fell awaye from that God, when he contempned his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and as it were, ſhaked of his yoke, and was a fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. Nowe therefore we perceyue for what cauſe he here
<pb facs="tcp:10157:28"/>
calleth him ſelfe an Hebrewe, and teſtifyeth him ſelfe to be the worſhipper of the true God. Firſt when he ſayth that he is an Hebrew, he diſcerneth the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> from the Idolles of the Gentiles. For in all thoſe places, the Religion of the elected people was ſufficientlie knowne, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by the conſent of all men it was diſallowed: For both the <hi>Cilicians</hi> and al the <hi>Aſiatikes,</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi> alſo, and on the other ſide, the <hi>Syrians</hi> knewe, what thing the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> vaunted of, euen that the true God appeared vnto theyr father <hi>Abraham:</hi> and alſo had made with him a frée coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt: and further, had geuen the lawe by the handes of <hi>Moſes:</hi> all this by fame was ſufficiented blazed abroade. Therefore now <hi>Ionas</hi> declareth him ſelfe to be an Hebrew: as if he ſhoulde ſaye, that he medled not with any faygned God, but with the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which in tyme paſt had appeared to the holy Fathers, and alſo which had rendred an eternall teſtimony of his wyll by <hi>Moſes.</hi> We ſée there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this, that he is an Hebrew, to be put <hi>Emphatically,</hi> or for the more plainer expreſſion of that which is intended. Afeerwardes he addeth: <hi>I feare the Lorde God of Heauen.</hi> By the worde <hi>feare,</hi> is vnderſtande <hi>vvorship.</hi> For it is not taken as it is oftentimes otherwhere, or in the proper ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therof: but <hi>feare</hi> is tranſferred vnto <hi>vvorship:</hi> I ſayth he, am not geuen to ſtrange ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but haue bene inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in true pietie: God hath reuealed himſelfe vnto me from mine infancie. I therefore adore none Idoll, as almoſt all Nations haue forged or inuented Gods for them ſelues: but I worſhip God the creatour of heauen and earth. He calleth him, <hi>God of the heauens,</hi> that is, which onely dwelleth in the heauens, &amp; ſéeing that others imagined heauen to be ſtuffed with a great multitude of Gods. Here <hi>Ionas</hi> ſetteth againſt them one onely God: as if he ſhoulde ſaye, Fayne for your pleaſure an innumerable company of gods, yet is there one which beareth the chiefe principalitie in the heauens: he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it is which <hi>Made the Sea and the drie lande.</hi> Nowe then
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:10157:28"/>
we perceyue what <hi>Ionas</hi> intendeth by theſe wordes. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen here he declareth that it is no maruaile, if ſo grieuouſly God doth perſecute him, for that he hath not perpetrated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny lyght offence, but a deadlie ſinne. Nowe we ſée howe greatlie <hi>Ionas</hi> profited, when the Lorde beganne to handle him roughlie. For being ſléepie as he was, yea rather ſenſeleſſe in his ſinne, he had neuer repented but by this ſo violent a remedie. But, when the Lorde by his ſeueritie had awaked him, by and by not onelie he confeſſeth himſelfe guyltie, or lyghtlie acknowledgeth his faulte, but we ſée howe that wyllinglie, and that vnto prophane men, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth him ſelfe to be wicked, euen ſuch a one as hath fallen awaye from the true God, in the worſhyp of whome he ſo well had bene inſtructed. This is the fruites of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce: and this alſo is the fruite of the chaſtiſement which the Lorde layde vpon him. Therefore if we wyll haue our repentaunce to be allowed of God, let vs not geue backe, as is the common vſe: neyther yet let vs make lyght of our ſinnes, but with a frée confeſſion, let vs teſtifie before all the worlde what we haue deſerued. It followeth after, that thoſe men feared with a great feare: and ſayd, <hi>VVherfore haſt thou done this? for they knewe that he fledde from the preſence of the Lorde, becauſe he had tolde them.</hi> This thing is of ſome waight, <hi>That the Shipmen feared with great feare.</hi> For <hi>Ionas</hi> ſignifieth that they were not onelie moued with his ſpeach, but alſo excéedingly afrayde, ſo that they gaue glorie to the true God. For we knowe howe that ſuperſtitious men in a manner ieſte with theyr Idolles. Yet truelie oftentimes they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceyue marueylous terrors, but afterwards they flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them ſelues, &amp; after a ſort kotchell their own minds, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may pleaſantly &amp; ſweetly laugh in their own delights. That therfore <hi>Ionas</hi> here ſayth, that, <hi>They feared with a great feare,</hi> he ſignifieth that they were ſo wounded, that nowe in déede they perceyued the God of Iſrael to be a iuſt Iudge: and againe not to be, as the reſt of the Gentyles fayned him
<pb facs="tcp:10157:29"/>
to be, but to be armed or furniſhed with feareful examples, as often as he is wylling to take vengeaunce. We ſée then what <hi>Ionas</hi> meaneth, when he ſpeaketh of great feare. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though eache is to be marked, that they feared, euen for that it was eaſie to gather out of the words of the Prophet, that the God of Iſrael was the onely maker of heauen and earth: then that which followed of great feare muſt hither be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, euen as I haue alredy ſaide, vnto an earneſt and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous feare, ſeing that all feare immediatly vaniſheth awaye from thoſe which beléeue not. But where as the ſhipmen and the reſt of the paſſengers did chide <hi>Ionas</hi> here the Lorde payeth vnto him the rewarde which he had deſerued. He had fledde from the preſence of God, by this meanes as we haue ſaide, hadde he abrogated from God the chéefe ſouerayntie. For what manner of aucthoritie is that of Gods, if euery of vs refuſeth his commaundements and fléeth from his ſight? when as therfore <hi>Ionas</hi> would priuily eſcape God, he is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued vnto men.

                        <p>The ſame thing ſée we in <hi>Ionas:</hi> Euen whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the Maiſter of the ſhyppe firſt rebuked his drowſie ſléepe, when he ſayd, at the leaſt thou yet call vpon thy God: what meaneſt thou O thou ſléepie heade? thou lyeſt here lyke a blocke: and in the meane tyme, ſéeſt vs to be plunged in extreame daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.

For when the ſea is calme it is ſayd to be quyet, but when it is troubleſome, then hath it diuerſe motions &amp; toſſings. <hi>The Sea,</hi> therefore dyd goe, or wrought, then it was tempeſtuous: we ſée then that God was not contented with the ignominie of <hi>Ionas,</hi> but woulde alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſecute his faulte, <hi>Ionas</hi> therefore muſt be brought to the puniſhment which he had deſerued, although myracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſlie he was afterwarde delyuered from death, as we ſhal ſée in place conuenient. <hi>Ionas</hi> then aunſwereth: <hi>Take me, and cast me into the Sea, and it shall depart from you:</hi> Here ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a queſtion: whether <hi>Ionas</hi> ought of his owne accorde to offer himſelf to death, for this ſéemeth to be a token of deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For he mought ſubmit himſelf to their cenſure. But here as it were, he pricketh them forewarde: <hi>Cast me</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>into the Sea, for otherwiſe then by my punishment, ye shall not pleaſe God.</hi> He ſéemeth lyke a deſperate man, when ſo of his owne minde he haſteneth to his ende. But without doubt <hi>Ionas</hi> perceiued that from aboue he was required to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is vncertaine whether he then conceyued any hope of ſafegard, that is whether with preſent confidence he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted himſelfe vpon the fauour of God, but whatſoeuer it be, we may yet gather that he commeth foorth to death, becauſe he vnderſtandeth, and is certainely perſwaded that he was therevnto ſoommoned after a ſorte euen by the manifeſt voyce of God, and ſo it is not doubtfull but that patiently he vndertaketh the iudgement, that the Lorde hath brought
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:10157:31"/>
againſt him. Therefore ſayth he: <hi>Take me and cast me into the Sea, and afterwarde the Sea shal depart from you.</hi> Here <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> not onelie pronounceth that God may be pacified by his death, becauſe the Lotte fell vpon him, but elſe otherwyſe knoweth he that his death may ſuffice in ſtéede of Sacrifice, that the tempeſt maye ceaſe. And to the ſame ende foloweth the reaſon: <hi>I knowe</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>that for my ſake this tempest is vpon you.</hi> When as he ſaith he knoweth, this cannot be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the Lotte, for this knowledge was common vnto them all. But <hi>Ionas</hi> here as it were by the ſpirite of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie ſpeaketh. And there is no doubte, but he confirmeth the thing that I firſt touched, euen the God of Iſrael to be the chiefe and onely king of heauen and earth. This cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of knowledge therefore, of the which <hi>Ionas</hi> ſpeaketh, ought firſt to be referred to his conſcience: ſecondly, to the inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of godlineſſe wherwith he was endued. But now we maye gather out of theſe wordes a moſt profitable doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, euen that <hi>Ionas</hi> here reaſoneth not the matter with God, neyther contemptuouſly doth frete that God ſo ſeuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie puniſheth him. For he taketh vpon him wyllinglie both the guyltineſſe and the puniſhment, euen as firſt when he ſayde, I am the worſhipper of the true God. Howe confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth he y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true God, whoſe moſt heauy hande he at that time felt? But we ſée <hi>Ionas</hi> ſo to be ſubdued, that he left not of to yéelde vnto God his iuſt honour: yea although preſent death were before his eyes. Although the wrath of God burned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, yet we ſee (as we haue ſaide) howe he gaue vnto God his honour. So the ſame in this place is repeated: <hi>Beholde</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>I knowe that for my ſake this great tempeſt is ligted vpon you.</hi> He certainely murmureth not againſt God, that vpon him ſelfe taketh all the blame. This therefore is the true confeſſion of repentaunce: when as we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God, and wyllinglie alſo witneſſe before men that he is iuſte, although to our fleſhlie ſenſes he ſéeme cruelly to rage againſt vs. When as we geue vnto him the prayſe of
<pb facs="tcp:10157:32"/>
righteouſneſſe, then truelie doo we ſhowe our repentaunce. For except the anger of God conſtraine vs to this humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, alwayes we ſhalbe fylled with bytterneſſe: and howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer we waxe ſilent for a tyme, our harte notwithſtanding wyll be contemptuous and rebellious. Therefore this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie alwaye foloweth repentaunce, euen tyll the ſinner proſtrateth himſelf before God, &amp; willingly taketh vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him his offence, &amp; endeuoureth not by ſhifting ſleights to eſcape. And it is no maruayle that <hi>Ionas</hi> ſo farre humbleth himſelf. For we ſee the Shypme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to doo the ſame, when they ſay, that the Lotte is to be caſt, adding withal: <hi>Come &amp; let vs caſt Lots, that we maie know vvhy this euill is happened vnto vs.</hi> They drawe not God within the compaſſe of the Lotte, but they appoynt him for Iudge, and by this meane acknowledge they, that they are iuſtlie puniſhed. And yet euerie one thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him ſelfe to be innocent: for howſoeuer their conſcience dyd gnawe them, yet no man thinketh himſelfe culpable of ſo great offence, that he ſhoulde come vnder the vengeaunce of God.</p>
                        <p>When as yet I ſaye, the Mariners thought them ſelues frée from ſuch wickedneſſe, they therefore brawle or quarrel not with God, but ſuffred him to be Iudge aboue all men. When as therfore ſo barbarous men conteined themſelues within theſe boundes of modeſtie, it is no maruayle if <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> chieflie being throughlie awaked, and beginning to féele his ſinne, and hardlie helde alſo vnder the hande of God, it is (I ſaye) no maruayle, if then he confeſſed him ſelfe faulty toward God, and worthelie to ſuffer ſo great and gréeuous puniſhment. This is therefore to be noted howe he ſayth that he knoweth, that for his cauſe this tempeſt happened vnto them, or that the Sea was ſo tempeſtuous againſt all men.

And becauſe he confeſſed himſelfe guilty, and refuſeth not the puniſhment, hereby it came to paſſe, that they which were prophane men and in a manner barbarouſe deſired to ſpare his life. And when as euery man might be amazed at the preſent perill, this more increaſeth the miracle, that they yet had reſpect vnto the lyfe of him, who alone was in the fault, and who now freely had confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſame. But the Lord ſo turned their mindes, that it might more clerely appeare vnto vs, how gréeuous a crime it is to flye from the calling of God, and not willingly to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baye his commaundements, as we haue alredy ſaide. Many thinke this to be but a light offence, and ſo eaſily flatter them ſelues: but it lyeth not in the iudgement of man, to weyghe offences: this is a deceytful ballaunce, when men eſtéeme their ſinnes by their owne ſence.

But yet many harden themſelues, and yet haue they a ſeared conſcience, and neuer can ſhake of that error of minde, but that they ſhall alwaies feele them ſelues to be abhominable both to God and man, whyle thus they ſhedde innocent blood. Hence doth it come that the Shypmen, which otherwiſe had in them ſcarce one droppe of humanitie, yet doo humblie flée, for ſuccour vnto God, when it touched but the death of one onelie man, and here they ſaye, <hi>Anah Iehouah, <hi>VVe beſeech thee O Lorde.</hi>

                        <p>We ſée therfore that although theſe men neuer taſted the doctrine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, yet naturally were they ſo inſtructed, that they knewe, that mans blood was déere and precious vnto God.

Why (ſaye they) ſytteth he alſo as a Iudge to condempne vs, who him ſelfe is the firſt author of our tranſgreſſion: becauſe he ſo appointed it?

to worſhippe God. But in this place, that which is added, doth ſhewe that the manner of ſpeaking is more reſtrained: for there is added, <hi>A great feare.</hi> Therefore <hi>Ionas</hi> ſignified that the Mariners and other Paſſengers were touched not onelie with a certaine feare of God, but alſo perceyued the God of Iſrael to be the chiefe king of heauen and earth, and to holde all thinges in his hande and Imperie. Neyther is it any doubte but that this feare ſo brought them to true knowledge, that they perceyued that they were mocked before, and that whatſoeuer the worlde hath faygned, to be a méere toye and deceypte. And that the Gods made by the mindes of men are nothinge elſe then méere Idolles. We vnderſtande nowe the mynde of <hi>Ionas.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But here are we to ſpeake ſome what more largely of the feare of God. The ſcripture when it ſpeaketh of the feare of God,<note place="margin">The feare of God two wayes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, &amp; true pietie.</note> ſometyme meaneth outwarde worſhippe ſometime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, true pietye. Where outward worſhip is touched there it is a ſmall thinge. For hipocrits are accuſtomed to vſe their ceremonies and teſtifye that they worſhip the true God: but yet becauſe they ſubmite not themſelues vnto God with a ſincere affection, neyther bring foorth fayth nor repentaunce, therefore doo they nothing els but mocke and counterfeyt. But the feare of God is oftentymes taken for godlyneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it ſelfe: and then is it called the beginning and the head of wiſdom, and alſo wiſdom it ſelfe, as in the booke of <hi>Iob:</hi>

This ſeruile feare is full of contumacye, becauſe they which cannot exempt themſelues from his power and Imperye, yet doo gnawe the brydle. Such was this feare whereof <hi>Ionas</hi> he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

here maketh mencion ſo ſodainely were not chaunged, that they wholy addicted themſelues to God. For they had not proffited ſo much, neyther was the conuerſion of their mindes ſo perfect and true, that they were thereby chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into new men. How then feared they? Euen as God wreſted from them a certaine confeſſion for a tyme. It may yet bee that ſome of them proffited them for the more and more: but I now ſpeake generally of all.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe therefore they feared God, we cannot thereby gather that they ſo wholy were conuerted, that they al af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward were addicted to the God of Iſrael. But yet they were conſtrayned to perceyue and confeſſe the God of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, to be the onely and true God. By what meanes? for that the fearefull iudgement of God had ſtrocken a terrour into them, ſo that they perceyued him to be onely God whiche contained vnder his gouernement both heauen and earth. Now then we ſée in what degree this feare is to bee placed which <hi>Ionas</hi> here toucheth. For if afterwarde there folowed no better progreſſe, or going forward in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trueth, this was onely of force to conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pnation, becauſe when as theſe ſhipme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by this manifeſt inſtruction, acknowledged the onelie God, yet they mingled their wicked &amp; impious ſuperſtitions with his worſhip, as in many men it is ſéene at this daye.</p>
                        <p>The Papiſtes holde one principle with vs, that the onely God is the maker of heauen and earth: yea, they come née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer alſo, euen that the onelie begotten Sonne of God, is our redéemer. But in the meane time we ſée howe they pollute the whole ſeruice of God, and turne his trueth into lyes, &amp; mingle God with Idolles, in ſuch ſort that there is nothing pure among them. But that principle is much woorth, if God doo reache his hande to miſerable men. For if in the Papacie this were not certainely helde, that the woorde of God is to be credited, and Chriſt the ſonne of God to be king and heade of the Church, there were long circuitions to be vſed with them: but we haue a familiar enteraunce vnto

them. For when we obiect both the law, the Prophets, and the Goſpell, they are helde then with a certaine reuerence, neyther dare they contempne the authoritie of the moſt high God. We ſée therefore howe this feare of it ſelfe is to ſmall purpoſe, if men ſticke ſtyll in their olde myre; but if the Lord wyll call them further, this feare then openeth to them the gate vnto true pietie. So (as I haue ſayde) it might be, that ſome of the Mariners and other ſhypmen after that profyted more: But that feare of it ſelfe coulde nothing elſe doo, but conuince them, in ſuch ſort that no excuſation might profite them before the iudgement ſeate of God: becauſe a token was ſhewed, whereby they might knowe that there was none other God, then was called vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the elect people. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he addeth, that they <hi>Offered a Sacrifice vnto the Lord.</hi> They were accuſtomed before, to offer ſacrifices to their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, but now they declared that they worſhipped the God of Iſrael: for to this ende doo belong the Sacrifices. But withal this is to be noted, that this confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was of them expreſſed, that God might confirme the faith or credit of his word. For when they perceyued this whole matter to be gouerned by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wyl of God, they were compelled to confeſſe that he was the true God, and this was the ende and ſcope of the Sacrifice.</p>
                        <p>But here it maye be demaunded, whether that Sacrifice pleaſed God. It is certaine that ſo ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For God wyll haue no fellowe, as it is ſufficientlie knowne. And alwaye that ſaying of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> is to be kept in memorie: <hi>Goe ye, and Sacrifice to the diuel, and not vnto me,</hi> ſayth the Lorde. God there refuſeth all Sacrifices which they were woont to offer among the people of Iſrael, euen becauſe there were ſuperſtitions mingled with them. God therfore declareth that he ſo diſaloweth theſe mixtures, that he had rather that ſuperſtitious men ſhoulde be wholie ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the diuell, then that his ſacred name ſhoulde ſo be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:10157:37"/>
prophaned. Therfore of it ſelfe this ſacrifice was neyther lawfull, nor coulde pleaſe God: but by <hi>Accidens,</hi> or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlie (if I maye ſo ſpeake) this Sacrifice pleaſed God: becauſe he woulde haue his glorie by this meanes to flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and ſhine.<note place="margin">Howe the worke of a wicked man maye pleaſe God.</note> And although he refuſed the ſhypmen them ſelues, yet woulde he haue this worke to be ſome teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of his glorie: as for example: Oftentimes the worke in reſpect of the man may be corrupt, and yet after an acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall manner it ſhall tende to the glorie of God. And this is dilygentlie to be noted. For at this daye there is a diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or rather a ſharpe contention about good workes: And the Sophiſters in this ſubtyle argument or Paralogiſme deceyue them ſelues, becauſe they thinke or imagine that workes, morally good, eyther are preparatorie to the obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of grace, or elſe are meritorious or deſeruers of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſaluation. When they ſaye workes morally good, they onelie reſpect or regarde outward appearaunces: they ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpect the fountaine from whence they come, nor yet the ſcope whereto they tende. If the harte of man be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, certainely the worke that procéedeth from thence ſhal be alwayes vnpure and ſhall ſtinke in the ſight of God. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if the ende be wicked, that is, if the purpoſe of men be not to worſhippe God, and that with a ſincere hart, euen that worke which is otherwiſe moſt excellent, ſhalbe moſt filthie in the ſight of God.</p>
                        <p>To chyldiſhly therefore and farre are the Sophiſters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, when they ſaye that workes, morallie good, do pleaſe God, or be preparatiues vnto grace, or deſeruers of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But howe maye it be that a worke ſhoulde not pleaſe God, and yet tende to his glorie? I aunſwere, that this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie well agréeth, neither is there here any contrarietie, which eaſilie cannot be accorded. For God after an acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall manner, as I haue already ſayde, applyeth thoſe things to his glorie, which of them ſelues (I ſaye, of them ſelues, that is in reſpect of men) are verie corrupt. So alſo in the
<pb facs="tcp:10157:38"/>
Papacie the name of a Chriſtian ſerueth to the glorie of God, for alwaies ſome remnau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chriſtianity remaineth. For howe commeth it to paſſe, that in this time the light of the goſpell hath appeared out, when as yet at the leaſt in few places true pietie hath bene reſtored? Forſooth, becauſe the Lorde neuer ſuffered true Religion to be quite extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed or quenched, in that place where yet it hath bene corrupted. In the Papacie therefore, <hi>Baptiſme, the verie name aſwell of Christ as of the Church,</hi> Finaly, <hi>A certaine forme of godlineſse:</hi> All theſe of them ſelues were vnprofitable altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but yet after an accident all ſort, are of force, euen as I haue ſayde. But if we conſider aſwell the Sacrificers, as alſo the common ſorte of people, we ſhall finde, that they doo nothing but paruert the worſhip of God. When as raſhlie and lyke a hodgepodge, they ioyne their ſuperſtitions and inuentions to the worde of God, no ſinceritie is obſerued. When therefore they thus confounde heauen and earth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, nothing elſe doo they but prouoke vpon them ſelues the wrath of God. Nowe therefore we knowe why <hi>Ionas</hi> ſayth, that the Shypmen and Paſſengers offered Sacrifices to God. But yet this alſo is to be remembred that I latelie ſayde, this Sacrifice to be a ſigne of the worſhip of God. For from the beginning, alwayes this opinion remayned in the hartes of all men, that Sacrifices were not to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but to God onelie. And prophane men in all ages none otherwiſe déemed of Sacrifices, but euen that by them, they ſhewed foorth their Religion towarde the Gods.</p>
                        <p>When as therefore Sacrifices from the beginning haue bene offered to God alone, it followeth that they at this day are inexcuſable, which adioygne ſome as fellowes, with God, and vnto mortall men or Angels, offer their Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Howe maye this be borne in Chriſtians, ſith the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles alwayes haue confeſſed that they tooke them alwayes as Gods vnto whome they were accuſtomed to offer their ſacrifices?

But now ſéeing God pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth his chiefeſt Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to be Inuocation, as we reade <hi>Pſa. 50.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Pſa. 50.15</note> In the Papacie al Religion is quite peruerted, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they not onelie inuocate God, but alſo the verie creatures, neither doubte they more often to flée for ſuccour vnto <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> yea, euen to Saintes of their owne making, counterfeyt and feygned, then vnto one God. When as therefore they ſpoyle God of that his chiefeſt ryght, we perceyue that with that their ſacriledge they treade vnder foote all pietie and godlyneſſe. If therfore prophane men teſtified that they worſhipped the Lord, and the God of Iſrael onelie, with that their outward ſacrifice: let vs at this daye learne not to tranſferre the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of good right belonging vnto God, to the creatures, but let this honour, euen that he onelie maye be inuocated, remaine wholie and inuiolable vnto him: becauſe this, euen as I haue ſayde, is the chiefeſt and moſt precious ſacrifice that he requireth and alloweth.</p>
                        <p>Nowe alſo <hi>Ionas</hi> addeth that, <hi>The Shipmen vowed vowes to God.</hi> This appertaineth to geuing of thankes, or is a parte of thankſgeuing. For we knowe that in vowes alwaies this hath bene the intent, not onely of the holie Fathers, but alſo of ſuperſtitious Hipocrites, both to binde them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to God, and alſo to geue him thankes, and teſtifie that they owe vnto him or ſtande bounde vnto him both for the preſeruation of their lyues, and alſo for any other benefite that happened vnto them. And this was the continuall courſe in vowing vowes, in all ages. Therefore when as nowe the ſhipmen made vowes vnto God, certainely they renounced their Idolles. Fyrſt they cryed out to their gods, but nowe they vnderſtande that they brayed in vaine, and without profite: for that raſhlie they caſt abroade their voyces in the ayre. Nowe therefore they direct their vowes to the true God, becauſe they knowe that their lyues be in his hande. And hence is it eaſie to be collected,<note place="margin">The So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſters mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake the Scripture.</note> howe fooliſhly the Sophiſters heape togeather at this daye all the places of

Scripture which entreate of Vowes, or where any menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made of Vowes. For they thinke, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempne their wicked vowes, that we are vtterly ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and vaniſhed with their vaine collection of that verie worde, <hi>Vowe.</hi> And yet none of vs euer denied, neyther doo deny,<note place="margin">It is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to make a vowe ſo that we make the word of God our warraunt.</note> but that it is lawfull to make a vowe, ſo that it be done by the preſcription of the lawe and the goſpell: that is, ſo that men doo not raſhlie obtrude vnto God, whatſoeuer commeth in their minde, but doo vowe that which is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto him: and againe, haue with them a right &amp; iuſt ende of their vowes, euen that they maye thereby teſtifie their thankfulneſſe in the ſight of God.<note place="margin">The ende of vowes.</note> But in common vowes there be moſt palpable corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as there is alſo in all the Popes Religion: becauſe they doo confuſedlie vowe this or that to God,<note place="margin">Why there be corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the vowes of the common people or of the papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</note> and neuer reſpect what the Lorde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth or alloweth: As one man for certaine dayes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaineth from eating of fleſhe. Another man kombeth not his head for a certaine tyme. And another wandereth in ſome pylgremage. We knowe that all theſe thinges are refuſed of God. Againe, admitte, they vow nothing but that which is allowed of God, yet is that alſo verie proſperouſly done, becauſe they wyll néedes by this manner binde God vnto them. And alwayes that deuiliſh opinion of <hi>Deſert</hi> or <hi>Merite</hi> ſticketh in their mindes. Laſtlie alſo, they neuer reſpect what they them ſelues are able to doo, but they vowe perpetuall chaſtitie, when as yet incontinencie doth burne them: and ſo we ſée that after the manner of the Gyaunts, they fight and ſtriue againſt God him ſelfe, and withall doo permitte vnto them ſelues an vnbridled lybertie, to vowe any thing what they lyſt. Let vs knowe therfore that as often as the Scripture ſpeaketh of vowes,<note place="margin">Two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples vſed of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures when it ſpeaketh of vowes.</note> it taketh theſe two principles, euen that vowes, becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the worſhippe of God, ought not to be vndertaken without any difference at the pleaſure of men, or as men lyſte, but ought to be reduced and referred vnto their rule,

Which thing againe more euidentlie ſhalbe declared in his Canticle or Pſalme. But nowe one queſtion is to be handeled of vs,
<pb facs="tcp:10157:41"/>
whyther God created at that tyme the Fiſh which receyued <hi>Ionas.</hi> For ſo much that ſaying (that: <hi>God prepared a Fish</hi>) ſéemeth to inferre. For if the Fiſh had at that time ſwamme in the Sea, the Prophet might haue vſed another worde, as thus: The Lorde cauſed that the Fiſh ſhould <hi>Occurre,</hi> or: the Lorde <hi>Sent</hi> a Fiſh, for ſo the ſcripture is woont to ſpeake. But here, the Fiſh is ſayde to be prepared. But this doubt maye be reſolued thus, that although God created not the Fiſh at that tyme, yet dyd he diſpoſe the ſame to this vſe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we knowe that this was not done naturallie, that a Fiſh ſhould ſwallowe <hi>Ionas:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The fiſhe was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that it was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the ſauegard of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. <hi>Gul. Rondele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi>
                           </note> and againe, ſhould thrée dayes and three nightes kéepe him vnperiſhed in his bellie. I ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore referre that which here is ſpoken of (that a <hi>Fishe was prepared</hi>) vnto the conſeruation of <hi>Ionas.</hi> And certaine it is, that there be ſome ſuch Fiſhes which are able to ſwallowe men whole. And <hi>Guleielmus Rondeletus,</hi> who wryt a booke of the Fiſhes of the Sea, by probable reaſon, gathereth that it was a Fiſh called <hi>Lamia.</hi> He ſawe that Fiſh whome he ſayth to be of ſo large a bellie and broade mouth, that eaſilie maye ſwallowe one man: and fayth alſo, that ſometyme there was founde in the bellie of that Fiſh <hi>Lamia,</hi> an armed man. Therefore as I ſayde, eyther a Whale, or a <hi>Lamia,</hi> or ſome Fiſhe vnknowen vnto vs, maye deuowre a whole man: but he which ſo is ſwollowed vp, lyueth not in the bellie of the Fiſh. Therefore <hi>Ionas,</hi> that he might note the myracle, ſayth that this Fiſh was prepared of the Lorde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was receyued into the bellie of the Fiſh, as into a friendlie harborough or lodging. For there although he reſted not in minde, yet in body he was as ſafe as if he had walked on the lande. When as therefore contrarie to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Nature, the Lorde preſerued his Prophet there, no maruayle it is, if he ſaye that the Fiſh was prepared of the Lorde.

Then therfore he taketh him to a new minde, becauſe when he was at liberty, he thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might after a ſort mock God: he was a fugitiue from the Lorde: but nowe when he is ſhutte vp in outwarde myſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, he beginneth to praye, and of his owne accorde ſetteth him ſelfe in the ſight of God.

And this circumſtaunce is alſo of vs to be marked, for the wordes ſounde, as if he ſhoulde ſaye, that he prayde out of the verie helles. But howe coulde it be, that he then dyrected his prayers vnto God, by whoſe hande he ſawe himſelfe to be ſo ſeuerelie puniſhed? For God moſt ſeuerelie handeled him. <hi>Ionas</hi> was after a ſorte dryuen to eternall
<pb facs="tcp:10157:42"/>
deſtruction, for the bellie of the Fyſh, euen as we ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſée, was as the bellie of hell, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graue. And yet in this deſperation, <hi>Ionas</hi> gathereth his ſpirites to him and taketh courage, &amp; can take him ſelfe the right waye vnto God: this is a wonderfull and almoſt an incredible example of fayth.<note place="margin">A lawfull and fyt time to praye, is when the Lorde pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth vs.</note> Therefore let vs learne to waigh well what here is ſayde: that when the Lorde puniſheth vs hardlie, then is there a lawfull &amp; a fyt tyme to pray. But we know how the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter parte of people diſpayre, and are not woont to offer their prayers vnto God: but when their mindes be quiet. But God himſelfe then chiefly inuyteth vs vnto him, when as we are brought to greateſt extremity. Let vs therefore remember that which <hi>Ionas</hi> telleth of himſelfe, euen that he cryed vnto God out of the verie helles. And with all he alſo confyrmeth, that his prayer proceeded of true fayth: for he ſayth not ſimply, that he prayed vnto the Lorde, but alſo he addeth, <hi>his God.</hi> But he ſpeaketh earneſtlie and verie dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beratelie. Well: <hi>Ionas</hi> although he were not onelie lyke a deade man, but almoſt condempned, yet perſwaded with him ſelfe that God for all this, notwithſtanding woulde be mercifull vnto him, if he fledde for ſuccour vnto him.</p>
                        <p>We ſée therefore that <hi>Ionas</hi> by chaunce as hypocrites are woont to haue the name of God in their mouthes, when they be oppreſſed: but he prayed ſeriouſly: becauſe he was perſwaded that God woulde be mercifull vnto him. Nowe it is to be marked that the prayer of <hi>Ionas</hi> was not vttered in theſe wordes which here are mencioned: but <hi>Ionas</hi> while he was in the belly of the Whale meditated with himſelfe theſe cogitations.</p>
                        <p>After what ſorte therefore he was affected, he declareth in this Canticle, and we ſhal certainly ſee that he was drawne euery waye: as in temptations it muſt néedes be that our mindes ſhould be moued hether and thether. For the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts of God enioy not the victorie without great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we muſt therefore playe the ſouldier &amp; that valiauntly,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:10157:42"/>
that we may get the victory. <hi>Ionas</hi> therefore in this Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle ſheweth that he was toſſed with great diſquietneſſe &amp; ſharpe tormentes: but with all he ſheweth that this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple was ſtedfaſtlie fyxed in his minde, that God muſt be ſought vnto, and againe, that he ſéeketh him not in vaine, becauſe he is alwayes ready to helpe thoſe that be his, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as they ſhall crye vnto him. And therefore he ſayth: <hi>I cried vnto the Lorde when I was in trouble, and he aunſwered mee.</hi> There is no doubte but that <hi>Ionas</hi> mencioneth after he came out of the belly of the Whale, what happened vnto him, &amp; gaue thankes to God. This firſt verſe therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth two partes. Firſt that <hi>Ionas</hi> in his diſtreſſe, fledde for ſuccour vnto God: The ſeconde parte conteyneth a thankſgeuing for that, marueylouſie and contrarie to all fleſhlie imagination he was delyuered: I haue cryed (ſayth he) in my tribulation vnto the Lorde, I cryed out of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of hell, and thou heardeſt my voyce. <hi>Ionas</hi> as we ſhall hereafter ſée, not without great contention directed his prayer vnto God: he ſtriued with many difficulties: but howſoeuer many impedimentes dyd concurre, yet went he forewarde and ſtayed not from prayer.</p>
                        <p>Now he alſo declareth that he prayed not in vayne: for that he might the more amply ſet out the grace of God, he ſaith: <hi>out of the belly of the graue:</hi> He put this word, <hi>Affliction,</hi> in the firſt member of the verſe, but here more clerely doth he expreſſe how notable and worthy of memory was the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of God, that he eſcaped ſafe out of the belly of the Whale, becauſe the ſame belly of the fiſhe was as the belly of the graue. <hi>Schol</hi> the Hebrewes cal the graue,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Schol</hi> verie often taken for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graue.</note> of the corruption that is therein. And the Latin interpreter almoſt in euerye place hath tranſlated it, <hi>Hell:</hi> and ſometime <hi>Schol</hi> is taken for <hi>Hell</hi> it ſelfe: of the eſtate of the reprobates, whereby they perceyue themſelues condemned in the ſight of God, but more often is it taken for the graue, which ſince I gladly in this place keepe, euen that the fiſhe was lyke the graue. But
<pb facs="tcp:10157:43"/>
he ſignifieth that he was ſo encloſed in the graue: that there appeared no way out. What is the belly of the graue? euen the moſt inward and déepeſt part of the graue.

                        <p>But <hi>Ionas</hi> here ſetteth God before his eyes, <hi>I am caſt away</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>from thy ſight.</hi> He doth not expoſtulat or debate the

And then he addeth. <hi>At the least I will ſee yet againe thy holy temple.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he ſpeaketh of the Temple, there is no doubt but that he ſet before him the Temple of God in Ieruſalem, as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce of fayth. For when he was abiected, he gathered together all thoſe things which might ſéeme to be able to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhe and erecte his hope: For he was Circumciſed; he was a worſhipper of God according to knowledge, he was brought vp in the lawe, he was exerciſed in ſacrifices: vnder the name of the temple therefore, he comprehendeth al theſe things briefly we ſée therefore how he animateth himſelfe in extreme daunger and neceſſity.<note place="margin">Note.</note> And this admonition is profitable for while we ſée al paſſage or entraunce vnto God to be ſhut vp againſt vs, there is nothing more profitable then to call to minde, that yet from our firſt infancie he hath adopted vs, and againe that he manifeſted his grace with many ſignes chiefly that he hath called vs by the goſpel into the ſociety of his onely begotten ſonne who is the lyfe and ſaluation: and againe that he hath confirmed this grace both by baptiſme, and the ſupper of the Lord.

As touchinge the worde it ſelfe, <hi>Aſaph,</hi> in the Hebrewe ſignifieth to couer: it alſo ſignifieth in <hi>Niphal</hi> and <hi>Hithpael</hi> (in which coniugation it is here taken) to Fainte: But the former ſignification maye wel be kept, euen that his ſoule wound vp it ſelfe together as in the <hi>102. Pſalme,</hi> the prayer of the afflicted when as in miſery
<pb facs="tcp:10157:47"/>
he gathered himſelfe together and prayed. They which expounde it: <hi>To multiplie prayers,</hi> are voyde of all reaſon I therefore doubt not, but that <hi>Ionas</hi> here meaneth, eyther that he was ouerwhelmed with a certaine fayntneſſe of mynde, or els that he was ſo perplexed, that he could not but with a violent contention mount vp vnto God. What ſo it be, he woulde by this worde expreſſe the perplexity of his mynde. Therefore when as we ponder in our myndes diuerſe Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and continue as it were faſt bound in vtter daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, then is our ſoule ſayde to tumble or roule it ſelfe vp and downe in vs. And when the ſoule wrappeth it ſelfe vp together, all the cogitations of the perplexed man fall down vpon him. We couet to eaſe our ſelues, when as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolue diuerſe imaginations, but what ſo we endeuor to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerte elſe whether, by and by redoundeth vpon our heade, and ſo our ſoule windeth it ſelfe vp together vpon vs. Now we knowe what <hi>Ionas</hi> meaneth in the firſt member of this verſe, <hi>VVhile my ſoule gathered it ſelfe vp together,</hi> or fainted in me. Then he ſayth, <hi>I remembred the Lorde.</hi> By this we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that <hi>Ionas</hi> was not a victor without great difficulties, euen to the faynting of the ſoule, as we haue ſayde, and this is one thing. In the meane tyme we gather againe, that he neuer was ſo oppreſſed with temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but that he ſought the Lorde at the leaſt with his prayers. This principle therefore <hi>Ionas</hi> kept with him, that God is to be ſought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, although for a time ſo hardlie and ſeuerelie he handeled him. For that <hi>Remembraunce</hi> whereof he ſpeaketh, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of faith.</p>

                           <hi>euen vnto God.</hi> We ſée therfore that <hi>Ionas</hi> ſo remembred his God, that with faith he acknowledged, that he woulde be mercifull vnto him. And from this procéeded his deſyre to praye. Nowe that he ſayth, that his prayer entered into the Temple, there is no doubte, but that he alludeth vnto the rytes of the Lawe. For the Iewes were accuſtomed to turne them ſelues, as often as they prayed, towarde the Temple, and this Ceremonie was not ſuperſtitious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we knowe that <hi>Doctrine</hi> was propounded vnto them, which inuited them vnto the Sanctuarie &amp; the Arke of the Couenaunt, when as therefore this manner was vnder the Law, <hi>Ionas</hi> ſayth, that his prayer came in vnto the Temple of God: becauſe the Temple was a viſible token whereby the Iewes might conceyue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God was amongſt them: not that they might with a wicked imagination faſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or ioygne God to the outwarde ſignes, but becauſe they knewe that theſe helpes were not in vaine geuen vnto them. After this ſort therefore <hi>Ionas</hi> not onelie remembred his God, but alſo called to minde the ſignes, in which he had all his lyfe long exerciſed his fayth, as we ſayde of late. For they which take Temple for <hi>Heauen,</hi> altogether ſtraye from the minde of the Prophet.

he ſhalbe acceptable to God, he triumpheth ouer all faigned inuentions, which men haue wickedlie deuiſed for them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and with the which they are drawne awaye from the true God and his ſincere Religion. For, <hi>lying vanities,</hi> he calleth all the deuiſes of men, wherewith men deceyue them ſelues: for certaine it is that they be meere falacies and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, that men frame vnto them ſelues without the worde of God: becauſe there is one onely and ſimple trueth, which the Lorde hath reuealed vnto vs by his worde.

                           </hi> that is, do cutte of them ſelues from al felicitie. For there is no ayde or helpe elſe where to be hoped for, but from God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: but this place is diligentlie to be noted. For from hence we gather what accoumpt all ſuperſtitions, that is, al opinions or imaginations of men are to be made of, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they wyll at their pleaſures inſtitute a Religion, for <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> calleth them lying, or deceyptfull vanities.

                        <p>Againe, this is to be noted that in vaine do men buſie them ſelues whyle they follow their owne inuentions. For looke how much the more couragiouſlie they runne, ſo much the farther depart they backe from the waye: as ſayth <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin.</hi>

When as therefore men wander out of the worde of God, they doo after a ſort driue awaye God him ſelfe from them, or byd him adew. And ſo it commeth to paſſe, that they are depriued of all good thinges, becauſe, beſide God, there is no hope or ſaluation founde. Very notablie therefore <hi>Ionas</hi> addeth immediatlie: <hi>But I in the voice of praiſe will ſacrifice vnto thee.</hi> As if he ſhoulde ſaye: ſith that men doo caſt forth them ſelues into exyle, at what tyme they addict them ſelues to their errors, therefore vnto thée onelie O Lorde wyll I ſacrifice. All this is dilygentlie to be marked of vs: for as our wittes or diſpoſitions are prone vnto lyes and vanities, eaſilie at the firſt euerie ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wyll carie vs awaye, vnleſſe we be kept in with this hande, euen that we be ſurelie perſwaded, that perfect ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and whatſoeuer helpe or ayde is to be looked for, doth reſt in God alone. And when this is wel &amp; throughlie prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our hartes, then ſhall not true Religion eaſily depart from vs: although Sathan on euerie ſide laye his deceypt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſnares for vs, yet ſhall we continue in the true &amp; ryght Religion of God. And ſo much the more dilygentlie is this place to be marked, for that <hi>Ionas</hi> here woulde confirme him ſelfe in the right courſe of pietie. For he perceyued that he was, as all mortal men are, prone to lyke of lying vanities, vnleſſe he ſhoulde animate him ſelfe vnto conſtancie. And he confirmeth him ſelfe, when he pronounceth whatſoeuer ſuperſtition men do inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be the depriuation from chiefe felicitie, from lyfe and ſaluation. And hereby it commeth to paſſe that we doo abhorre all error, if we be perſwaded that
<pb facs="tcp:10157:50"/>
we leaue the true God and together with him caſt awaye from vs our ſaluation and whatſoeuer good thing maye be wyſhed, when we obay not his word. <hi>I will,</hi> therefore, <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vnto thee with the voice of praiſe,</hi> ſayth <hi>Ionas.</hi> And, here againe is to be noted that the true worſhip of God chiefly conſiſteth in prayſe and thankeſgeuing,<note place="margin">The true worſhip of God chiefly conſiſteth in thankſge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and prayſe.</note> as is ſayde in the <hi>50.

For God neuer ſtayed as contented with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrifice of <hi>Calues, Oxen Gtoes and Lambes,</hi> but he woulde alſo be acknowledged to be the author of all good things, and therefore in that Pſame he ſayth. <hi>Sacri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore that without any let or diffycultie, that reſtitution which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, maye floriſh and be of force with vs, let vs remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that by his worde and becke, the worlde was created of nothing, and ſtyll is ſuſteyned. But if that generall doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine ſuffice not, let this Hiſtorie of <hi>Ionas</hi> alſo come into our minde, that God commaunded the Fyſh that it ſhoulde caſt out <hi>Ionas.</hi> Whence then was it that <hi>Ionas</hi> eſcaped ſafe and ſounde? euen becauſe ſo it pleaſed the Lorde, becauſe the Lorde commaunded. And that worde at this daye retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the ſame efficacie, therefore according to the power whereby it worketh all thinges, we in tyme to come ſhall be rayſed vp alſo from death.

                           <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Ere is a notable example of the grace of God ſet foorth vnto vs, in that he vouchſafed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue <hi>Ionas</hi> into his former degrée &amp; honor, for he was vnworthy to lyue. But God not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie reſtored him to lyfe, but againe adorned &amp; bewtified him with the office and tytle of a Prophet. This as I haue ſayde <hi>Ionas</hi> gotte not, but by the rare and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar grace of God. For when he firſt fledde, and ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe diſobedient, he depriued him ſelfe after a ſorte, of all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God: that he therefore recouered the office of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, for certaintie came not to paſſe by his Deſert. This is to be noted in the firſt place, when it is ſayde, <hi>That the worde of God, came the ſeconde time.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Note howe God ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to men.</note> And nowe the manner of ſpeaking is to be marked, becauſe, diuerſe wayes is the worde of God directed vnto men. For God ſpeaketh to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one of vs: but he ſpeaketh after a ſpeciall manner vnto the Prophetes, whome he wyll haue to be Preachers and wytneſſes of his wyll. Therefore as often as God placeth any man in any perticular office, he is ſayde to direct his worde vnto him: euen as the worde of God is directed to the Magiſtrates, when as they are bidden to exerciſe the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie committed vnto them. So alſo the worde of the Lorde alwayes came vnto the Prophets, becauſe it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them to intrude them ſelues; vnleſſe they were
<pb facs="tcp:10157:52"/>
called of God. Nowe followeth the commaundement.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ariſe and goe to Nineueh into that great Citie, and preache there the preaching which I commaunde thee.</hi> We ſee here that God repeateth againe the ſame thing which he dyd at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: that <hi>Nineueh</hi> is a great Citie, to the intent that <hi>Ionas</hi> might take to him an inuincible courage, and maye come thether well aduiſed. For hereby it commeth to paſſe, that many men very bouldly exerciſe their office for a time, but ſoone after, they faynt, becauſe the difficulties were not ſufficiently foreſeene of them. And then when men finde more trouble then they thought at the beginning, they euen faynt almoſt, or at the leaſt are vtterly diſcouraged. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lorde here in tyme, and verie prouidently foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>Ionas,</hi> howe harde his office ſhoulde he: as if he had ſayd, I ſende thée being a man vnknowne, and of baſe eſtate, and a forrenner, that thou mayſt denounce deſtruction, not vnto a fewe men, but vnto a great multitude, and that thou maiſt haue a conflict with a moſt noble Citie, and ſo populous that it maye ſeeme to be a certaine Region.</p>
                        <p>Nowe therefore we know why the praiſe of the Citie was added, euen to be a great Citie, for that <hi>Ionas</hi> might prepare him ſelfe to vndertake and paſſe through this battell, leaſt he afterwarde in the middeſt of his courſe ſhoulde faynt. But marke, that the feare of this thing, euen that the Citie was great and populous, dyd in the beginning woonderfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maye him, inſomuch that he fledde from the calling of God. But nowe he is nothing moued with the greatneſſe of that Citie, but conſtauntlie he followeth the Lorde, whether he calleth him: we ſée therefore howe fayth when it once hath gotten the victorie in our hartes, doth mount aloft ouer all impedimentes, and contempneth all the greatneſſe &amp; glory of this worlde. Nowe by and by is there added.</p>

For although <hi>Ionas</hi> caſteth in him ſelfe the greatneſſe and pryde of the Citie <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neueh,</hi> yet of ſo great courage is he, that he forgetteth that he is but one man, obſcure and vnarmed: but by and by he taketh to himſelfe thoſe weapons which might beate downe all the power of the worlde, becauſe he knoweth that he is ſent from God. He ſet God on his ſide, whome he knoweth to be the author of his calling. And hereby commeth it to paſſe, that with an hye and vnfeareful minde he deſpiſeth all the glorie of the Citie <hi>Nineueh.</hi> Whereby we ſée that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayde truely, that our victorie conſiſteth in faith,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.4</note> whereby we ouercome the whole worlde. And with all <hi>Ionas</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth howe greatlie he profited vnder the correction of God. He was ſeuerelie chaſtened, and we knowe that many vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuers waxe the more obſtinate and harde harted, by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and doo euen ſpew out their madneſſe and poyſon againſt God: But <hi>Ionas</hi> here quite contrarie ſheweth that,<note place="margin">How profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table the Lordes chaſtiſement is to his children.</note> that chaſtiſement was profitable to him, becauſe he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed vnto the obedience of God. <hi>He went forwarde,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>according to the commaundement of God:</hi> that is, he reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing elſe, but that he might obey God, and ſuffer him ſelfe wholy to be gouerned of him. And out of this place alſo we gather, howe well the Lorde prouideth for vs, and our ſaluation, when as he correcteth our contumacie or diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: although his chaſtiſementes be verie ſharpe, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becauſe ſo great profit enſueth, we know that there can no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better come vnto vs (as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh in the <hi>Pſa. 119</hi>) then to be humbled vnder the hande of God.<note place="margin">

Well: nowe alſo we knowe howe <hi>Ionas</hi> gathered to him ſelfe ſuch fortitude, euen becauſe he had by experience tryed in the bellie of the Fyſh, that euen in the middeſt of a thouſande deathes, there is yet in God helpe ſufficient to recouer health and ſafegarde. And becauſe he knewe that the extremities of death are in the gouernment and hande of God, yea, though the whole world ſhoulde ryſe againſt him, he is not ſtricken with feare, that for that, he ſhoulde refuſe the commaundement of God. Therefore, howe much the more any man perceyueth that God is fauorable and beneficiall vnto him, ſo much the more couragiouſlie ought he to procéede in his office, and ſecurelie to commyt his lyfe and ſafegarde vnto God, and conſtantlie to ouercome all the daungers of this worlde. Afterwarde he ſayth, <hi>That Nineueh was a great Citie,</hi> euen, <hi>of three daies iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</hi> Some men labour much here to diſſolue a doubt, where no cauſe is, and in loſeng a knotte where none is: becauſe this ſeemeth to be abſurde, that one Citie ſhoulde conteine in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe about, thyrtie of our Leagues, or thereabout. When as they therfore conceyue in their minde a kinde of abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, by and by they inuent remedies, euen that no man can ſo beholde all the Citie, that he maye viewe all the Lanes, all the Stréetes, and all publique places, vnder thrée dayes: yea, they adde alſo, that this ſhoulde be vnſterſtoode, not that a man ſhoulde runne through the Citie, or ſwyftlie ſhoulde paſſe through it, but that ſlowlie he ſhoulde contemplate and beholde it, and might ſtaye in the hye wayes.</p>
                        <p>But theſe are childiſhe excuſes, for if we will beléeue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, wryters, <hi>Nineueh</hi> certainly was of that greatneſſe, which is here ſpoken of by <hi>Ionas.</hi> For they ſay that it was

Seing therfore this was ſo, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the city could not be leſſe, then here is by <hi>Ionas</hi> declared. Yf theſe things ſéeme to paſſe common credit, yet wryters made not this of nothing. For admit that many falſe things are founde in <hi>Diodore</hi> and <hi>Herodot:</hi> yet as touching thoſe cities certainely they durſt not lye. For <hi>Babilon</hi> as then ſtoode, in the ſight of all men, the ruinouſe places of <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueh,</hi> alſo ſtoode, although long before it were ouerthrowne:<note place="margin">In Nine. 120000. children.</note> Againe we ſhall ſée alſo about the ende of the booke, that the Citie was ſo great and populouſe that in it there were an hundred and twenty thouſand children. Who ſo therefore wyll not receyue the teſtimonye of <hi>Ionas,</hi> let him feede himſelfe with the lyes of the deuil. For when as there were in it ſo many children, what now reſteth but that we may ſay that very great was the circuite of the city? But that which a little after foloweth ſéemeth to be contrary to this. For <hi>Ionas</hi> ſayth that when he entered into the city, he fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in one day the courſe of the city, and preached: the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is eaſie, that as ſoone as he entered into the Citie, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to publiſhe the commaundement of God. Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there followed ſome conuerſion: therefore <hi>Ionas</hi> ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that in one daye he paſſed through the whole citie. But in the firſt day he conuerted vnto him parte of the city: and then he ceaſed not to exhort all men to repentaunce and ſo folowed the conuerſion of the whole Citie, but not in the ſecond nor yet in the third day as we may ſufficiently gather. Now let vs go on to the reſt.</p>

And yet, the minde of the holy Patriarche muſt be by ſome other meane rayſed vp then by the threatninges, to builde the Arke, to be for him a ſanctuarie of ſafegarde.

When as therfore they do humbly proſtrate them ſelues before God, certainlie they conceyue ſome hope of grace and fauour at Gods hande.

But ſeeing that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meditation of Repentaunce is daylie, yet is not Faſting alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qired of vs. It foloweth then that Faſting is a publique and ſolempne teſtimony of repentaunce, where there appeareth any extraordinarie token of the vengeaunce of God. So alſo we ſeacute;e in <hi>Ioel</hi> that the Iewes were called vnto Sackcloath &amp; Aſhes, becauſe God as it were prepared to the battaile came foorth amongſt them: and all the Prophetes cryed that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction was at hands to the people, and therefore it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Iewes to flye for ſuccour vnto God with ſuch teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.

                           </gap>te, euen becauſe this ought to be done in extremities. Nowe therefore we vnderſtande why the king after he himſelfe had put on ſackcloth commanded alſo to the whole people both faſting and other teſtimonies of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce. But this ſéemeth to be abſurde yea very ridiculouſe, that the king commaundeth the beaſtes, as well as men to profeſſe repentaunce: For repentaunce is the chaunge of a man while he reſtoreth himſelfe vnto God, when as he was before from him enſtraunged: and this can by no meanes fall out in bruite beaſtes. Raſhlie therefore and contrarie to all reaſon doth the King of <hi>Nineueh</hi> mingle Beaſts with men, when as he entreateth of repentaunce: But that is to be noted which firſt we ſpake, euen that deſtruction was denounced not to men onely, but alſo to the whole Citie, and alſo to the verie edifices and buyldings. For as God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the whole worlde for mans ſake: ſo alſo his yre, when it is once kindled againſt men, Inuolueth with al both Cattel and Trees, and whatſoeuer is eyther in heauen or in earth. But for al this, the queſtion is not yet aunſwered: for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer God taketh vengeaunce of the beaſts for the offences of men, yet an Oxe or a Shéepe can not pacifie the anger of God. I aunſwere, that this was done for mans cauſe. For it had bene a notable feaſt, if the king had forbyd the beaſts
<pb facs="tcp:10157:59"/>
all ſuffenaunce, except he had had reſpect vnto men them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. But he would as it were in a glaſſe, or a picture ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Nineuits</hi> what they had deſerued: as it was vnder the Lawe, as often as they ſlewe any Sacrifices, they were admoniſhed of their ſinnes. For this ought to haue come in mind vnto them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Lambe, or other creature, was ſlaine being innocent, &amp; for what cauſe he which had offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded ſtoode at the Aultar. For there he ſawe a liuelie image of his owne da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pnation in the Oxe, La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be or Goate. So alſo the <hi>Nineuits,</hi> when they conſtrained their Oxen &amp; Aſſes, and the reſt of the beaſts to faſt, they were admoniſhed of howe gréeuous &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they were worthy, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> very inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent beaſts ſuffered puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t together with them. We ſée therefore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the king ſought not to make any ſacrifice, whyle he commaunded a faſt &amp; hunger to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very brute beaſts: but rather y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> men were with ſuch prickes ſtyred vp, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſeriouſly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> anger of God, &amp; to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue the more terror, whereby they might the more be humbled before God, and ſhould be diſpleaſed with themſelues, &amp; ſo might be the more readie and better framed &amp; prepared to craue forgeueneſſe &amp; pardon. Now therfore we ſée y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this commaundement of the faſting of the beaſts, ought to be referred vnto the touching of mens conſciences with feare, as they which had flattered them ſelues too much, and therefore by ſuch a remedy might amended and correct their deadly drowſineſſe. And to this ende belonged the waſhings in the Law to purifie veſtures and the reſt of the veſſels. Euen that the people might know that whatſoeuer they touched was defiled with their filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And this is dilygently to be noted: becauſe the Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, as they are geuen to Ceremonies, ſnatche vp whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer in any place of the Scriptures is read, of Faſting, of Sackcloath &amp; Aſhes, and thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all godlyneſſe is included in theſe outward rites. And yet, bodily exerciſe profiteth not much,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>1.</hi> Tim. 4.8</note> ſayth <hi>Paul.</hi> Therfore this rule ought alwayes to be of force with vs, that Faſting &amp; ſuch like of them ſelues are of nought: but onelie ought to be conſidered of by their ende.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:10157:59"/>
So therefore when as the bruite beaſtes with the <hi>Nineuits</hi> were conſtrayned to hunger, men themſelues being admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed of their own guiltineſſe, learned what it was to feare the anger of God: and for this cauſe that Faſt pleaſed God.</p>
                        <p>Nowe if any man wyll obiect, that there is nothing to be gone about in the worſhippe of God, not mencioned in the worde, or contrarie to the worde: eaſie alſo is the aunſwer,<note place="margin">A notable Queſtion, Anſwered.</note> that the King of <hi>Nineueh</hi> by this, inuented not any kinde of pacifying of God, neyther woulde he by this meanes wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyp God, but had reſpect vnto the ende whereof I ſpake. And that ende verie well agréeth vnto the worde of God, and the preſcript rule thereof. Therefore the king of <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueh</hi> tryeth here nothing ſtraunge &amp; vnknowne to the word of God, when he referreth all things to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſkope, euen that he with the people might come forth hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blie before the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeate of God, and with earneſt penitencie and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, may deſyre pardon. This aunſwere then is playne inough. When as therefore <hi>Ionas</hi> addeth, that the King co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded both the people, &amp; the beaſts to put on Sackcloath: let vs knowe, that if any man wyll ſnatche vp this naked example to immitate it, he ſhoulde be nothing elſe but a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: becauſe alwayes this reaſon is to be obſerued, that the King ſought helpes wherwith he might driue both himſelfe and his, vnto true repentaunce. And good reaſon it is, that we take heede in the immitation of this: for the nature of man is prone vnto a fooliſh zeale. And for the moſt part we are almoſt lyke Apes: but it is dilygentlie to be looked vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, with what ſpirite they were ledde, whome we couet to immitate, leaſt that we being content with the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearaunces, doo neglect y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is principal, or chiefe. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Ionas</hi> addeth, <hi>And they crie stronglie, or infortitude vnto God.</hi> This muſt be reſtrayned vnto the men (&amp; not vnto the beaſt) for it woulde not agrée vnto brute beaſtes. Well: the men and the beaſtes abſtaine from meate and drinke: and then the men crye vnto God. This crye coulde not ſpring,
<pb facs="tcp:10157:60"/>
but of the feare of God, and the perceyueraunce and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of godlineſſe. Therefore as I haue ſayde it ought not confuſedlie to be drawne as well to brute beaſts as men. But that the King of <hi>Nineueh</hi> commaunded the people, in fortitude, to crye vnto God, it is worthy the noting: for here hence we gather that he was in déede throughlie ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. For here is no mencion of the common crying, but he addeth, in <hi>Fortitude,</hi> as if one ſhoulde ſaye, with open throte, and in Frenche we ſaye, <hi>A force,</hi> or <hi>forte,</hi> or <hi>terme,</hi> with force ſtronglie, or firmely. <hi>Ionas</hi> therefore expreſſeth a thing rare &amp; ſingular, when as he recyteth that this was compriſed in the Kings Edict, that men ſhould crie ſtrongly vnto God. And it is as much as if he ſhould ſay: Let al men now awake to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhaking off their deadly ſléepe. For to much hytherto hath euerie one of vs kotcheled himſelf in his ſins: Nowe time it is that feare begynne to poſſeſſe our hartes; and driue vs forwarde to craue the fauour and loue of God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">This King thought prayer to be the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to get the fauor of God.</note>And this alſo is worthy to be noted, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king inuenteth not any other remedy, but that the people ſhould flye vnto prayer. And it may well be that <hi>Ionas</hi> exhorted the <hi>Nineuits</hi> vnto it: but we may eaſily gather: that this perceiueraunce is ingrafted in vs by nature, that when we are vrged with aduerſity, then doo we implore and craue the fauour &amp; grace of God. Well then: <hi>To praye vnto God,</hi> is the onely remedy in all afflictions, and miſeries. If we therefore being taught both in the lawe and the Goſpell, doo not vſe this remedy, when God doth admoniſhe and exhort vs to repentaunce: what ſhew of excuſe ſhal we haue, ſeing that prophane men, which helde not one ſyllable of true piety, yet in miſerye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the Lord God, &amp; the King him ſelfe commaunded the ſame by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conſent of al his Nobility? More careful, modeſty therfore ought this Edict of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king to ſtrike into vs, then if a man ſhoulde but euen ſimply vtter this doctrine out of the word of God. For although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings authoritie be not equal vnto the aucthority of God: yet when that miſerable &amp; blind

prince acknowledged by the inſtinct of nature that God was to be pacified with prayer, what excuſation (as I haue ſaide) remayneth for vs? But <hi>Ionas</hi> ſheweth more playnely that, that the repentance of the people was not counterfeit, when he declareth that the <hi>Nineuits</hi> put on ſackecloth: and kept themſelues from meate &amp; drinke. Well: it followeth more in the edict of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king: <hi>And let euerie man turne from his wicked way, &amp; from the Rapine which is in their hands.</hi> This prophane king nowe declareth to what ende and with what determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he gaue commaundement of faſting and the other exerciſes euen that by this means the <hi>Nineuits</hi> might ſtirre vp themſelues the better vnto the feare of God.

If a man be caſt downe with terrour, and afterwards, taketh hart to him, hauing ſet before him the hope of pardon and ſaluation, yet by and by he ſhall not be voyde of al feare: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as long as he beholdeth his ſinne, and is alſo enwrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in other thoughts and cogitations, he ſhal wauer and be diuerſely toſſed in mynde. There is no doubt therefore, but that the king of <hi>Nineueh</hi> conceyued hope of ſaluation &amp; ſafegard: but in the meane time was perplexed in mind, as wel for the preaching of <hi>Ionas,</hi> as for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> guiltineſſe of his owne ſinnes. Two lets therfore there were which might cal backe the mynde of the king from aſſuraunce and certainty of his ſafegard, or at the leaſt might ſtaye him, that ſodainly
<pb facs="tcp:10157:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he ſhould not apprehend the mercy of God, and with a quiet mynde might thinke, that God would be propitiouſe vnto him. The firſt let, was that terrible Sermon of <hi>Ionas,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this: <hi>After fortie daies, Nineueh shall perish.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Ionas</hi> might adde ſome thing as we haue ſayde, yet ſo preciſe was that threatning that it might diſmaye the mindes of all men. It behoued the king therefore mightely to ſtriue, that he might ouercome ſo great a let, and repell &amp; dryue from him that terrible preaching of <hi>Ionas,</hi> ſo farre forth as it was voyde of all comfort and conſolation. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie, the king when he pondered and weyghed his ſinnes, might ſome what wauer. But we ſée howe he endeuoreth to eſcape, although he had theſe two impedimentes and hynde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunces before his eyes. Becauſe when he ſayth: <hi>VVho can tell whether God will turne awaye from the fierceneſse of his wrath, and repent?</hi> When he ſayth ſo (I ſaye) we ſée that he was in a ſtrong conflict: becauſe howſoeuer <hi>Ionas</hi> ſéemed to ſhutte vp from him the gate of mercie, and to forbyd &amp; deny him all hope of ſaluation and ſafegarde, howſoeuer alſo his owne conſcience kept him downe and oppreſſed him, he yet procéedeth, and pricketh him ſelfe forwarde: and ſo finally aſpyreth vnto hope of forgeueneſſe.<note place="margin">As if he ſhould ſaye: Repent, &amp;c. for you knowe not whether God wyll ſpare you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer or no, becauſe he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne you a long time. <hi>Ioel.</hi> 2.14</note> Againe, it is to be noted that this manner of ſpeaking, <hi>VVho can tel &amp;c.</hi> noteth rather difficultie, then diffidencie. For the king as it were, doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly enquyreth, <hi>VVho can tell whether God will turne him ſelfe?</hi> Becauſe it was a harde matter, that God, after ſo long ſufferaunce, ſhoulde yet ſpare that ſo wicked a Citie. The king therfore expreſſeth a difficultie. For this is not a ſigne of diffidencie or diſtruſt, when he ſo demaundeth. And when in <hi>Ioel</hi> it is ſayde, <hi>VVho knoweth, &amp;c.</hi> It is altogether the lyke ſaying: and therefore ſayde more, when he expounded that place. But let this brieflie ſuffice vs, that the king doth not bewraye his diſtruſt, but rather expreſſeth the difficulty and hardneſſe of the matter. And this is a ſigne of humility, that he vnderſtandeth that he is as it were drowned in the

<pb facs="tcp:10157:63"/>
And this is the reaſon why he ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in our eares,<note place="margin">Why the Lord threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs by his Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</note> ſo many chydings &amp; threatnings, when we come to heare the worde of God: Euen becauſe he wyll call vs backe from deſtrucio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, therefore (I ſaye) doth he talke angerlie with vs. Finally, whatſoeuer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scripture conteyneth concerning <hi>Repentance,</hi> &amp; the iudgement of God, ought wholy to be applyed to this vſe, euen that we maye come into fauor with God: becauſe he is eaſie to be appeaſed, and is ready alwayes to imbrace thoſe, which vnfaynedlie turne them ſelues vnto him.</p>
                        <p>Therefore in this example we vnderſtande that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth nothing elſe, as often as he dealeth hardlie with vs, but that he maye be at one with vs, and appeaſed towarde vs,<note place="margin">Howe we preuent the yre of God.</note> if we our ſelues wyll be iudges of our ſelues, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent his yre with a wylling deſire of harte: which is done, when as we craue pardon for our ſinne &amp; guiltineſſe, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and are diſpleaſed with our ſelues, thirdly, and alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that we are worthy of deſtruction. But <hi>Ionas</hi> ſeemeth here to place here the cauſe of ſaluation, in Repentaunce &amp; Workes: for he ſayth that the <hi>Nineuits</hi> obtained pardon, becauſe God reſpected their workes.

Then: <hi>God reſpected their workes:</hi> but what Workes? Not Sackcloath, not Aſhes, not Faſting, for <hi>Ionas</hi> maketh no mencion nowe of theſe thinges, but he reſpected theſe works, euen that they conuerted from their wicked waies. We ſée therfore that God was not pleaſed &amp; appeaſed with Ceremonies onely, that is, with that outwarde profeſſion of repentaunce: but rather that he reſpected the true and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous alteration in the <hi>Nineuits,</hi> euen that they were new me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                           </hi> euen as he reſtoreth his fauour vnto vs euerie daye fréelie. <hi>Ionas</hi> therefore meaneth not that theſe ſatiſfactions preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before God, as though the <hi>Nineuits</hi> had reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>penſed theyr former ſinnes: no ſuch thing doo the wordes importe: but onely by a conſequent we muſt gather, howe the Lorde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth againe fauorable vnto vs, and howe we obtaine pardon with him.

                           </label> THat <hi>Ionas</hi> ſayth here that hée prayed, ſéemeth ſcarce to be agréeable: becauſe prayer to be quyet, and he confeſſed that he was ſo molified in his minde. When as therfore the Prophet was ſo inflamed with wroth in his anger, howe could he come into the preſence of God,<note place="margin">Quiet prayer.</note> &amp; conceiue iuſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? againe what is the ende of prayer, but that we confeſſe that what ſo euer good thing is to be wiſhed, remaineth with God,<note place="margin">The ende of prayer.</note> and is humbly to be ſought and aſked of him? But <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> doth here rather debate the matter with God and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur againſt him. For he ſéemeth here after a ſort to ſkould and ſay, that he had a iuſt cauſe to runne away: and agayne that God ought not to forgeue the <hi>Nineuits.</hi> He therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth God, that he might cleare and deliuer himſelfe from al blame, and this is ſtraunge altogether and farre from the rule of prayer. How then muſt we vnderſtande this place, where he ſayth that he prayed? I aunſwere, that oftentimes the faythfull euen with a troubled mynde come vnto God with a deſyre to praye:<note place="margin">Note well.</note> and yet their prayers are not vtterly refuſed, although they be not allowed, nor yet pleaſe God in all poyntes. And by this place it appeareth more euidently howe the workes of the godly are acceptable vnto God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10157:66"/>
though they be mingled with many impurities.<note place="margin">Note.</note> The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts as often as they reade that any worke did pleaſe God, they imagine chiefe perfection and cleanneſſe: and yet there is no worke which is not infected with ſome ſpotte, except it be purified by free pardon.<note place="margin">How all works are purified</note> And this is euidente vnto vs in this prayer, which was not ſo reiected of God, but it obtained the name of a praier. And yet certaine it is that <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> was not ſo minded as he ought, when he praied trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomelie, as it were chyding &amp; brawling with God, and ſtyll retayning ſome parte of his former contumacie: becauſe he beganne to lyke well of his running away from God. And we haue ſayde that this was a manifeſt ſigne of rebellion, when as, ſhaking off the the yoke, he contempned the calling of God. It is neceſſarie therefore, that we acknowledge in this prayer of <hi>Ionas</hi> ſome parte of godlineſſe, and alſo many corruptions. This procéeded from pietie, euen that, all this notwithſtanding, he yet dyrected his complaints vnto God. For the Hipocrits although they come vnto God, and name him, yet are they altogether contrary to him, and wyllingly woulde they ſpew out their chollor againſt God. But <hi>Ionas</hi> here whyle he complayneth, although he kéepeth not a meane, but be caried awaye with a blinde and corrupt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and force, yet is he ready to ſubmytte him ſelfe vnto God, as we ſhal ſée at length. And this is the reaſon why he ſayth that he prayed. For he had not bene aſhamed to haue confeſſed any more greeuous faulte, if he had bene guiltie thereof. For he woulde not extenuate or leſſen his faulte, by the word of <hi>Praying,</hi> as the Hipocrites doo alwayes pretend ſome coulors or cloakes, when as they woulde couer their filthineſſe.</p>
                        <p>But ſuch was not the minde of <hi>Ionas:</hi> therfore when that <hi>Ionas</hi> ſayth that he prayed, generallie he teſtifieth that he was not ſo murmuring and diſobedient vnto God, but that he retained ſome ſeede of godlineſſe &amp; obedience in his mind. Well: <hi>Ionas <hi>praied,</hi>
                           </hi> and hereby it followeth (as I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb facs="tcp:10157:67"/>
ſayde) that many prayers of holie men are corrupt, which if they be ſtretched to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawful reach, they ſhalbe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelie refuſed But the Lorde for his mercie ſake forgeueth thoſe ſinnes, ſo that theſe vnquiet and troubleſome prayers, retaine and holde ſtyll their tytle and eſtimation.</p>
                        <p>Now he ſayth: <hi>I beſeech thee O Lorde, was not this my ſpeach.</hi> Here <hi>Ionas</hi> declareth euidentlie why he tooke it greeuouſlie, that <hi>Nineueh</hi> ſhoulde be delyuered from ſubuerſion: euen becauſe by this meanes he ſhoulde be taken for a falſe and lying Prophet. But this maye ſeeme abſurde, that the Prophet ſet more by, or made more accoumpt of his owne fame, then of the glorie of God. For in this doth the glorie of God chieflie ſhine, that he is appeaſed, ſo ſoone as men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: and alſo in that he offereth himſelfe to be a father vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Ought <hi>Ionas</hi> to haue preferred his eſtimation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the glorie of God? I aunſwer that the Prophet ſo was not addicted to him ſelfe, but that alwayes the ſtudie of the glorie of God obtained the higheſt degrée in his minde: this is certaine. But he ioygned his miniſterie with the glory of God, and worthely: becauſe it depended vpon his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Ionas</hi> when he entred into <hi>Nineueh,</hi> he cryed not as a priuate man, but profeſſed that he was ſent from God.</p>
                        <p>Now if the preaching of <hi>Ionas</hi> be founde falſe, the reproche redoundeth vpon the very author of his calling, that is vpon God. There is no doubt therefore but that <hi>Ionas</hi> tooke it gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſely that the name of God ſhoulde be layde open to the reproches of the gentiles, as though he ſhould make them a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>frayd of nothing and againe, ſpeaking diſſemblingly, ſhould by and by open hell and by and by heauen. And there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more againſt the glory of God, then ſuch diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on We ſee then why <hi>Ionas</hi> was carried away with ſo great ſorrowe: he reſpected not himſelfe, but becauſe he ſawe an occaſion geuen or a doore layde open to wicked blaſphemies, if God ſhoulde alter his determination, or if he ſhould not be conſtaunt in his word: here hence I ſaye came that ſo great
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:10157:67"/>
ſorrowe. But although this be a verye good reaſon,<note place="margin">We muſt not do euyl that good maye come of it. Ro. 3.</note> yet we gather of what force our good intents are with God. If any good intente may be imagined, certainely this might deſerue ſome prayſe, that <hi>Ionas</hi> had rather an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred times to dye then to here thoſe wicked blaſphemies, that the word of God ſhould be a mere laughing ſtock, that the threatnings of God were fables, that God did but diſſemble this or that as it he ſhould tranſfigure himſelfe into diuerſe formes.</p>
                        <p>This was an excellent intent, if we may be Iudges, or if the matter be eſteemed according to our ſences, but by and by we ſhall ſée that it was condemned by the mouth of God. Let vs learne therefore not to arrogate vnto our ſelues iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement in thoſe things which paſſe our capacitye, but to ſubmitte our minds vnto God, and to deſire of him the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of diſcretion and iudgement. How came it to paſſe that <hi>Ionas</hi> ſo ſhould frette againſt God, but that he was inflamed with the ſtuddy of his glory? but this was an inconſiderate zeale, becauſe he himſelfe woulde be arbiter and iudge: hee ought rather to haue ſubmitted himſelfe vnto God: and this ſame rule is to be kept of vs all. If at any tyme we ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things come to paſſe from aboue, that is by the ſecret pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God, which doo euen laye open the name of God to the blaſphemies of wicked and vngodly men, this truly is to be lamented: but in the mean tyme let vs deſire of the Lord, that he will at the length conuert thoſe reproches vnto his owne glory, but let not vs murmur &amp; grudge: as many doo, which by and by beginne to chide againſt God, as often as a thing is otherwiſe gouerned and directed, then they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues liſte, or doo thinke conuenient. Let vs learne by the example of <hi>Ionas</hi> not to meaſure the iudgements of God by our owne capacitie, but let vs paciently waight till he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the darkeneſſe into light. In the meane tyme alſo let vs learne to obey his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements, to follow his call with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controuerſie: although heauen and earth ſhoulde ſet them ſelues againſt vs, although many thinges do come in
<pb facs="tcp:10157:68"/>
our waye, which might turne vs awaye from the ryght courſe, yet let vs continue in this ſure determination, that nothing can be better for vs, then that we being obedient, maye go forwarde in the ſame waye which he ſetteth before vs. But where as he ſayth, that, <hi>He made haste to come to Tharſis,</hi> he doth not altogether excuſe his flight, but nowe he declareth more euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, that he had not refuſed any trouble or labour, nor yet had refuſed any controuerſie or daunger: but onely becauſe he was careful for the glorie of God, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was drawne away from his vocation. To this ende therfore tende the wordes of <hi>Ionas,</hi> as though he would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point God to be a witneſſe and a Iudge, that not for feare of daunger, nor for ſlouthfulneſſe, nor for rebellion, nor for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other reſpect, he withdrewe gim ſelfe from the obedience of God: but onely for that he woulde not haue his ſacred name violated and defiled, for that he would not wyllinglie be a Miniſter of that preaching, which might open y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mouth of vngodly &amp; prophane men to laugh God him ſelf to ſcorne. When as (ſayeth he) I hoped for none other profite of my preaching, but euen that the Gentyles might laugh God to ſcorne, yea, might teare in péeces amongſt them his holie name, as if he were deceyptfull and vaine, therefore had I rather flie vnto <hi>Tharſis.</hi> Therefore here <hi>Ionas</hi> doth not altogether excuſe him ſelfe: for then to no purpoſe had his chaſtiſement lyghted vpon him, whereby he ought to haue bene throughly tamed. He was called of late from the verie hell: ſhall we ſaye that he durſt ſo lyfte vp his hornes againſt God, that he would altogether be free from al fault? This certainely is to to abſurde: but as I haue ſayde, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth to God, that at the beginning he fledde not for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe, but for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hoped not for any plauſible fruite or ſucceſſe of his preaching, but rather he feared that which he ſawe imminent, euen that the name of God ſhoulde be a laughing ſtocke. Immediatly he addeth: <hi>Becauſe I knew that thou art a God full of fauour, and mercifull, ſlowe to anger, &amp;c.</hi>
                           <pb n="59" facs="tcp:10157:68"/>
This is ſurely marueylous that <hi>Ionas</hi> was called away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his vocation, becauſe he knewe that God was mercifull, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no ſharper goade ought to pricke vs forwarde, when as God wyll vſe our labour or dilygence. For we knowe that no man can performe his obedience chéerefullye vnto God, but he which is eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> allured with his fatherly goodneſſe. So then no man ſhalbe a wylling Prophet or Teacher, but he which is perſwaded that God is merciful. <hi>Ionas</hi> therfore ſeemeth to to fooliſhly to reaſon, when he ſayth, that he was therfore withdrawne from his office, becauſe he knew that God was mercifull. Againe, howe knew <hi>Ionas</hi> this? euen out of the lawe of God. For this place is taken out of the <hi>33.</hi> of <hi>Exod.</hi> where that notable and memoriall viſion is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed vnto vs,<note place="margin">Exod. 33</note> where God ſet out him ſelfe to be ſeene of <hi>Moſes,</hi> there was exhibited vnto the holy Prophet a lyuelie Image of God. And this is no place in the lawe, which bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more liuely expreſſeth the nature of God. For there God would familiarly manifeſt him ſelfe vnto his ſeruant. For when as therefore <hi>Ionas</hi> was ſo inſtructed and endued with this doctrine of the lawe, howe could he exerciſe the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Prophet amongſt his owne people &amp; countreymen? why dyd not this thought alſo vexe his harte, when he was called to the office of a Teacher? Certaine it is therfore, that this ought to be reſtrained vnto his preaching, ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was declared vnto vs. <hi>Ionas</hi> had neuer deſpiſed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God, if he had bene ſent to the <hi>Nineuits,</hi> eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as before he was commaunded to teach the elect people the Iewes. If therefore this office had bene enioyned to <hi>Ionas,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhoulde haue ſet forth God mercifull and gentle vnto the <hi>Nineuits,</hi> he had not doubted to haue offered his obedient ſeruice. But ſéeing this preciſe threatning was enioygned him: <hi>Nineueh <hi>shall perish:</hi>
                           </hi> therefore is he drawne away, and coueteth rather to runne awaye, then to execute ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. And why ſo? Forſooth he reaſoneth thus with himſelfe: I denounce imminent deſtruction to the <hi>Nineuits:</hi> To what ende doth God commaunde, but euen y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might
<pb facs="tcp:10157:69"/>
inuite and call theſe wretched men to repentaunce? Now if they ſhall repent, wyll not God by &amp; by be ready to forgeue them? for otherwiſe he ſhoulde denie his owne nature. God can not be vnlyke him ſelfe, or contrarie to him ſelfe, he can not put off that affection, whereof he teſtified once vnto <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> When as therefore the Lorde ſhall be appeaſed and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, if the <hi>Nineuits</hi> repent, and flee to him for ſuccour, he wyll by and by embrace them: and ſo ſhall I befound falſe in my preaching. Now therefore we knowe how this place of <hi>Ionas</hi> ought to be vnderſtanded, when he ſayth that he fledde ouer the ſea, (or at the leaſt, that was his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) becauſe he knewe that God was mercifull. For he had neuer diſſobayed God, but that this contrariety did trouble him and feare his minde: <hi>what?</hi> I ſhal goo thither as the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of God: ſhortly after I ſhalbe found a lyar: ſhall not this reproach redounde to the name of God himſelfe? it is better therfore that I holde my peace, then that God, which is the author of my vocation, be coumpted a ieſting ſtocke. We ſée therefore that <hi>Ionas</hi> had an eye vnto that manner of preaching which he ſhoulde vſe in <hi>Nineueh,</hi> whereof we haue ſpoken before. And hereby it appeareth that <hi>Ionas</hi> gaue more to the <hi>Nineuits</hi> then he had. For he thought that he was ſent from God, onely that the <hi>Nineuits</hi> might vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande that they muſt periſhe: but he brought ſaluation vnto them. This he in ſome parte eyther ſuſpected in him ſelfe, or knewe it. For be retayned that prnciple: that God could not put off from him his mercie, becauſe he remaineth alwayes one. But he came abroade to execute the office in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioygned him,<note place="margin">God vſeth our office to diuers ends vnknowne to our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues.</note> certainlie he had nothing elſe before his eyes, but the vtter deſtruction of the Citie of <hi>Nineueh.</hi> But in the meane time, God vſed his labour and myniſterie to a better ende and ſucceſſe. But there is no doubt but that <hi>Ionas</hi> him ſelfe exhorted the <hi>Nineuits</hi> to repentaunce: but his harte was as it were ſhut vp that it ſhould not admyt them the mercy of God. We ſee that <hi>Ionas</hi> was in his afflictions preuented, ſo
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:10157:69"/>
that he could not offer ſaluation to the <hi>Nineuits,</hi> and yet was it offered from God by his hand. Now then we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande howe the Lorde oftentymes worketh by is ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts: with his hand he leadeth them as blinde men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they lytle thinke. So when the Lorde ſtyrreth vp any of vs, we ſhalbe ſometime of ſmal fayth, we ſhal thinke that eyther our labour ſhalbe vnprofitable, and without fruite, or at the leaſt, that ſmall ſhalbe our ſucceſſe. But the Lorde wyll declare that ſucceſſe which we could neuer looke for. And ſuch was the example of <hi>Ionas,</hi> for when he came to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neueh,</hi> he had none other purpoſe, but to teſtifie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deſtruction of the Citie: but the Lorde woulde haue him to be the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of ſaluation, vnknowne to him ſelfe. Well the Lorde then adorned the doctrine of <hi>Ionas</hi> with this excellent ſucceſſe, when as yet he was vnworthy of ſo great honour, becauſe after a ſort he had ſhutte vp the paſſage to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, as we haue already ſayde.</p>
                        <p>Now therfore we know the meaning of this place, when <hi>Ionas</hi> ſayd that he fledde from the calling of God, becauſe he knew y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was a God proue vnto fauour, &amp; againe merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. &amp;c. Now I come to theſe ſpeeches of God. The Hebrew worde <hi>Chanun,</hi> ſignifieth properlie, <hi>Benigne, Gracious, and Debonaire:</hi> and God aſcribeth this tytle vnto him ſelfe Then he addeth: <hi>Mercifull,</hi> ſignifying that he alwayes is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs, if at any tyme we come vnto him, as vnto the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine both of all goodneſſe and mercie. But the wordes that followe, doo better expreſſe this mercie of God, or doo define howe God is mercifull, euen becauſe he is of much clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, next againe, ſlowe vnto anger. God therefore is proue vnto gentleneſſe: againe, although men be vnworthy whom he ſhoulde reſpect, he is yet notwithſtanding mercifull: and this he expreſſeth by the Hebrew word, <hi>Pachum.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">To loue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrelie.</note> In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane tyme it is neceſſarie to adde theſe two wordes together, That, <hi>he is of much mercie, and ſlowe to anger.</hi> And why? For we ſéeke alwayes in our ſelues the cauſe of the grace of
<pb facs="tcp:10157:70"/>
God: when as we couet that God ſhoulde fauor vs, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in our ſelues, why he ſhoulde fauor vs.</p>
                        <p>Now when we finde nothing, by and by al fayth which we firſt conceyued of the grace of God, vaniſheth awaye. And here then the Lord himſelf reuoketh &amp; calleth vs backe vnto him, and teſtifyeth that he is therfore fauorable &amp; mercifull vnto vs,<note place="margin">No cauſe in vs of our ſaluation.</note> becauſe he is of great mercy. As if he ſhould ſaye: I in my ſelfe haue ſufficient cauſe why I am exorable vnto you and why I alſo doo embrace you and take you into my fauour. The onely goodneſſe of God is therefore to be reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when we deſire to haue him mercifull vnto vs, or when we haue any néede of pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as if he ſhould ſay that he is not induced or moued with any reſpect of our worthyneſſe, nor yet doth ſéeke any of our merites, that therefore he ſhoulde be proue vnto mercy, when we haue offended, or ſhould take vs into his fauour: but that therefore he doth yet, becauſe his goodneſſe is immenſurable &amp; infinite. Now there is alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Slowe to anger.</hi> This flowneſſe to anger declareth that God prouideth for the ſaueguard of mankinde, yea euen when they are oppreſſed with ſinne, although therfore euery day, miſerable men doo prouoke vpon themſelues the wrath of God, yet ceaſeth he not to prouide for their ſafegarde: therefore is he ſlowe to anger, that is, the Lorde doth not ſtrayt way, lay vpon men ſuch puniſhment as they deſerue which ſo prouoke him. Well: nowe we ſee what is the ſum of the words. Now let vs returne to that ſaying, that <hi>Ionas</hi> was withdrawne from his office becauſe he knew that God was ſlowe to anger and mercifull, and full of fauour: For he brought in this reaſon, eyther God will chaunge his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or els he will ſpare the <hi>Nineuits</hi> if they repent: but it may be that they will repent, and then it followeth that my preaching ſhalbe vayne. And ſurely God wyl not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to himſelfe, but wil ſhew forth an example of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and mercy when he ſhall forgeue this people. Againe, let vs note that we doo wickedly, when as without Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:10157:70"/>
we followe our zeale. For there is ſome blinde furie, which then carieth vs awaye. Therefore although a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande abſurdities do come in our head, when God commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth any thing, yet are our eyes to be cloſed, as it were, and alwayes we ought to folowe on in the courſe of our vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: becauſe he wyll ſo moderate all euentes, that they all ſhall tende to his glorie. It is not our parte here to be to cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: but this is our beſt meane, that we let the euent of thinges alone vnto God. It is our part indéede to feare and to be carefull, but with all, this our care ought to ſubmyt it ſelfe vnto God, ſo that it ought to ſuffice vs, euen to pray. This is the ſumme.</p>
                        <p>Now that he ſayth againe, that, <hi>God doth repent him of euil.</hi> We haue expounded it a lytle before: euen that although he hath ſtretched out his hande, yet he plucketh it in againe as ſoone as he findeth any repentaunce in men. For, <hi>euill,</hi> here is taken for puniſhments: God therfore although he might, and that worthely lay vpon men extreame paynes and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, he yet ſuſpendeth his Iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and if they runne vnto him with true repentance, by and by he is pacified and appeaſed. And this is the repentance of God, euen that: what euer puniſhment and euil, men haue deſerued, he doth of his owne accorde remitte ſo ſoone as men are diſpleaſed with themſelues and repent. Now it followeth.</p>

                           </label> THere is no doubte, but God ſo chyding <hi>Ionas,</hi> condemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his faulte and corrupt zeale. For ſéeing that God onelie is a fytte Iudge of mans lyfe, there is no cauſe why we ſhould boſt that we are caried awaye with a good intent, becauſe there is nothing more deceyptful then is our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When as therefore we weygh the déedes, ſayings, or thoughts of our ſelues, in our own iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, we deceyue our ſelues. If any man wyl Rhetoricallie defend the fact of <hi>Ionas,</hi> certainly he may finde at hand many notable ſhewes. If a man would for his minde ſake, bring foorth the excuſes of <hi>Ionas, Ionas</hi> might ſéeme vnto vs altogether, innocent. But although all the whole worlde ſhoulde acquytte him, what ſhould that auayle him, ſeing that he is condemned by the mouth of God himſelf, who onely is Iudge? as I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſayde. Let vs therefore hould for certainty that <hi>Ionas</hi> dealt prepoſterouſlie, although no reaſon thereof appereth vnto vs, becauſe inough and more then inough might the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the cheefe Iudge God ſuffice vs.</p>
                        <p>Now playnely the Lord reprehendeth his anger. If <hi>Ionas</hi> had modeſtly debated the mattar, and had only caſt from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe his ſorrowes into the boſome of God, this had bene ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable:<note place="margin">The effects of anger.</note> although this zeale had not bene without fault, yet had it bene tollorable. But now when he is angry, this is not to be borne: becauſe <hi>Ira per ſe est furor breuis,</hi> anger it ſelf is a ſhort madneſſe or furye: as one ſayde: then afterward it blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the ſences of men, it perturbeth al the parts of the mind. God therefore not in one manner here accuſeth <hi>Ionas,</hi> but he declareth alſo howe grieuouſelye he fell, becauſe he ſuffered
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:10157:72"/>
himſelfe after this ſorte to be angry. In the meane time this is to be marked, that <hi>Ionas</hi> did not therefore onely offend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was angry, for he had ſinned alſo without anger as we haue ſayde: but God exaggerateth the crime by this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, euen that he ſo <hi>Murmured.</hi> And certainly this was a wicked example, when as a wretched ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ryſeth vp againſt God, and with a troubleſome ſpirite brawleth with him: This is a monſterouſe thing, yet was <hi>Ionas</hi> brought vnto this. We ſee therfore why there is here any expreſſe menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made of the Anger of <hi>Ionas,</hi> euen becauſe God wil by this meane houlde <hi>Ionas</hi> conuicted, leaſt he ſhould ſlyde backe any more. If he had ſayde ſimply: what? why doſt thou not permit me, al ſoueraigne iudgement? why doſt thou not willingly confeſſe that it is well done what ſo I doo, if it pleaſe me? is it thy part to take vpon thee ſuch wiſdome, that thou wilt preſcribe me a lawe, or wilt correct my Iudgements? if the Lord had ſpoken after this ſort, there might haue reſted ſome excuſe, as thus: Lord, I cannot moderate my ſelfe from ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe, when I ſée thy name ſo torne in peces with haynous reproaches, may I behould this with a quyet minde? <hi>Ionas</hi> might then I ſay haue yet founde out ſome clokes or excuſe: But when the Lorde layeth open and toucheth euidently the anger of <hi>Ionas,</hi> he muſt néedes of neceſſitye kéepe ſilence. For what thing ſhalbe found that will excuſe <hi>Ionas,</hi> when as he ſo rebelliouſely ryſeth vp againſt God being his iudge and maker, as I haue already ſayde. Well: now then we knowe why the Lord playnly expreſſeth, that <hi>Ionas</hi> did euill, in that he was thus angrye. And truly I meruayle what came in <hi>Hieroms</hi> minde, to ſay that <hi>Ionas</hi> here is not reprehended of the Lorde, but that there was ſet doune a certaine meane. Surely the man was both a Cauiler, and againe he playde the foole notably in corrupting the ſcriptures: he had no feare to wreſt the places of ſcripture euery waye: euen as when he diſputeth about <hi>Matrimonie,</hi> hee ſayeth,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that they which doo marry, doo not euill, but yet they doo not well: what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="tcp:10157:73"/>
of Cauil is this, and how filthy: And euen ſo in this place he ſayth: <hi>God doth not accuſe <hi>Ionas,</hi> neither yet reprehend his ſinne, for <hi>Ionas</hi> here rather ſetteth out vnto vs the perſon of Chriſt, who deſired death, that the whole world might be ſaued: Becauſe being a liue he could not win his owne Nation, neyther could holde his owne people: therefore had he rather beſtow and giue himſelfe and his life for the redemption of the world.</hi> Theſe are altogether trifling toyes, and doo vtterly depraue the whole ſence of this place. For this interrogation of God is of more vehemency, then if he had ſayde ſimply <hi>Thou hast offended in being ſo angrie.</hi> This affirmatiue kinde of ſpeeche had not had ſo great vehemencie, as this interrogation: For God not onely in the power of a Iudge, pronounced that <hi>Ionas</hi> doth euyll: but alſo wreſteth from him his own confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as if he ſhould ſay: Although thou thy ſelfe be Iudge in thine owne cauſe, yet canſt thou finde no excuſe for thine intemperancie: for thou art angrie without any meane. For when he ſayth, <hi>Lecha apud te, <hi>In thy ſelfe,</hi>
                           </hi> he calleth <hi>Ionas</hi> backe to the examination of his owne ſoule, as if he ſhoulde ſaye: Looke into thy ſelfe as in a glaſſe: thou ſhalt ſée, euen what a troubleſome ſea; thy minde is, nowe thou art caried awaye with ſuch a raging furie. Well, nowe we knowe not onely the naturall ſenſe, but alſo the vehemencie which lyeth hydden in this interrogation, although <hi>Hierom</hi> leaneth to the contrary parte altogether.

<pb facs="tcp:10157:74"/>
as yet we ſée that he was not inſtructed therof by an Oracle: yea rather the words that we ſée here, doo ſounde otherwiſe: euen that by the euent and falling out of the matter, it was manifeſted vnto him, that God had delyuered the Citie from deſtruction. For he ſayde in the laſt Lecture that God repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the worde which he had ſpoken, and dyd it not. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth therefore that <hi>Ionas</hi> went out of the Citie, vntyll the fortie dayes were full paſte. But nowe there aryſeth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary queſtion, what néeded he to ſytte néere the Citie, ſéeing it was euident that eyther the determination of God was chaunged, or at the leaſt the ſentence which he had vttered was altered. He ought not therefore as yet, as though he doubted ſtyll, to ſytte by the Citie.</p>
                        <p>But I doo wyllinglie admytte this coniecture, that <hi>Ionas</hi> after the fortyth day departed, and went out of the City. And the wordes doo ſéeme to bring vs thereto. As touching that queſtion, why he doubted what would be the euent of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſéeing he ſawe the tyme already expyred &amp; paſt, the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is eaſie. For although the fortie dayes were paſt, <hi>Ionas</hi> notwithſtanding ſtoode harde laſed, becauſe he coulde not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye perſwade him ſelfe, that the ſame ſaying which he vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at the commaundement of God, ſhoulde want effect and take no place. I doo not therefore doubt, but that this thought made him perplexed, when he thought thus of him ſelfe.</p>
                        <p>Thou haſt pronounced nothing raſhly. Nowe howe can it be that, the thing which God woulde haue to be publiſhed in his name and commaundement, ſhoulde nowe be to no purpoſe or fruſtrate, and that the euent ſhoulde not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording? When as <hi>Ionas</hi> therefore reſpected the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, if he coulde not by and by rydde himſelfe of al perplexitie. This therefore was the cauſe why as yet he ſtayed, euen for that although the vengeaunce of God was not as yet ſuſpended, he notwithſtanding thought that his preaching had not bene in vaine, and therefore that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Nineueh</hi> was at hande. Well: this was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:10157:74"/>
why he ſtyll wayted after the tyme prefixed, as though the matter had ſtill bene doubtfull.</p>
                        <p>But nowe that the thing maye be more plaine, we muſt note, that the counſayle of God was more ſecrete, then that <hi>Ionas</hi> might vnderſtande, yea euen in the very parts of his calling. For God when he threatned deſtruction to the <hi>Nineuits,</hi> would ſpeake condicionally. For what were the fruite of the worde, vnleſſe that condition were adioyned thereto, euen that if the <hi>Nineuits</hi> repented, they ſhoulde be ſafe? There néeded no Prophet: but that God woulde ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by prouide for their ſafegarde, for God coulde without him, haue executed that condempnation, which the <hi>Nineuits</hi> had deſerued. If any man wyll replie, that a Preacher was ſent vnto them, that they might be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more inexcuſable, this were a verie could reaſon. For God had exerciſed al his other puniſhmentes, without any ſuch dampnation: I meane a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt prophane Nations. For this was the peculiar gifte of the Church, that the Prophets denounced the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts that were at hande. But as concerning other people, God by the thing it ſelfe declared him ſelfe to be their Iudge: but ſent them no Prophets that might warne them.</p>
                        <p>Therefore as touching the counſaile of God, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the <hi>Nineuits</hi> to be terrified by that ſo preciſe Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, a condition ſure was included. But <hi>Ionas</hi> was to ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall a Doctor, that I maye ſo ſpeake: becauſe he compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended not that which he ought, euen that as yet there was place of Repentaunce, and that the Citie ſhoulde be ſafe, if the <hi>Nineuits</hi> repented from their wickedneſſe. Then when as <hi>Ionas</hi> ſnatched vp but the halfe parte, it is no maruayle though as yet he be of a doubtfull minde, and dare not yet determine what ſhoulde come to paſſe: God had not reuealed vnto him what he woulde doo, for <hi>Ionas</hi> had nothing before his eyes, but the ende or euent of his preaching. Nowe let vs proceede.</p>

But as touching the matter it ſelfe. I had rather in this place to leaue it either a <hi>Gourd,</hi> or a <hi>Cucummer,</hi> then to moue any trouble about a thing of nothing. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſayth, that it is not an Iuie, he ſayth it is a kinde of ſmall Tree: and ſayeth that it groweth euerie where in <hi>Syria.</hi> He ſayth that this ſmall Trée is helde vp by his ſtalke, and this cannot agrée to an Iuie. For the Iuie, vnleſſe it cleaue to a wall or a tree, it créepeth onelie on the grounde: it coulde not therefore be an Iuie. Wherefore he ought not to tranſlate it an Iuie.</p>
                        <p>He excuſeth the matter thus, that if he had put downe the Hebrewe name, many would haue imagined it eyther to he a Beaſt or a Serpent. He woulde therefore ſet downe ſome known name. But he might alſo haue caſt many doubts, as thus: what? An Iuie is ſayd to haue aſcended ouer the head of <hi>Ionas,</hi> and to haue geuen ſhadow vnto him: how could this bée? Nowe I maruayle why <hi>Hierom</hi> in one place ſayth that, that kinde of Trée was called in his tyme <hi>Cicijon,</hi> in the <hi>Syrian</hi> tongue: and in another place, euen in his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, he ſayth that it is called in the ſame tongue <hi>Elkeroa,</hi> &amp; we ſee that the ſame worde is quyte contrarie to the worde <hi>Cicijon.</hi> But nowe when he aunſwereth <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> I doubt not but that he mocked him. For he knewe that <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
                           <pb facs="tcp:10157:76"/>
knewe not the Hebrewe tongue. And therefore ieſteth he with him as with a childe, becauſe of his ignoraunce in the Hebrewe tongue. He ſéemeth <hi>ex tempore</hi> for his owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie to haue imagined ſome newe worde, and I doubte not but that he faigned it vpon a ſodaine. That there might be ſome affinitie betwéene the worde <hi>Kikijon</hi> and <hi>Cicijon.</hi> But howe ſo euer the matter is, whether it were a <hi>Gourde,</hi> or elſe ſome ſmall Trée, it is not conuenient greatlie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende howe it might ſo ſoone growe vp to that bygneſſe. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſayth that it is of large leaues, and that it increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to the greatneſſe of a Vine braunche. Bée it ſo: but that is not ſprong vp, neyther in one daye nor in two, no nor yet in three. Therefore it muſt needes be ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie thing For neyther an Iuye, nor a Gourde, nor yet any ſmall ſprought or any other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

God ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnto the ſhadowe of the Boothe addeth alſo this ſmall frée: that by this meanes <hi>Ionas</hi> might be refeſhed. For we know that in thoſe regions the ſunne is burning whot And againe it was an extraordinary heate, as we ſhall ſée. This is that which I was minded to ſpeake of the word, Iuye and I haue bene longer, then I thought to be: but becauſe in tyme paſte they brabled about that worde, I thought to runne ouer thoſe things which might ſatiſfie euen the cury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſe readers.</p>
                        <p>Now I come to the matter it ſelfe. <hi>Ionas</hi> declareth that a Gourde or Cucumer or an Iuye was prepared of the Lord. There is no doubte but contrarie to the accuſtomed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner this herbe ſodainely ſprong vp, that it might couer the Boothe of <hi>Ionas.</hi> And this is my Iudgement. But wée
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:10157:76"/>
knowe that as often as God dealeth contrarye to the order of Nature, yet he commeth vnto Nature it ſelfe. This is not perpetuall: but we ſhall finde for the moſt part, that God ſo worketh that he both excéedeth the courſe of Nature, and yet goeth not quyte from nature. Euen as when he in the deſerte would gather together quayles on a heape, and geue fleſhe to his people, he rayſed vp the Eaſte winde. How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten haue the windes blowed, and yet neuer brought together ſuch a multitude of byrdes? This was therefore a miracle,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Num.</hi> 11.31.</note> but yet God would not reiecte altogether the helpes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For then he vſed the wynde, but yet that wynde coulde not naturally bring thoſe byrds with it. So in this place I doubte not but that God choſe an herbe which quickly might mount to ſuch an height and yet he went beyond the acuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med courſe of nature. In this fence therefore it is ſayde that God prepared <hi>Kikijon,</hi> and made it to come vp ouer the head of <hi>Ionas,</hi> whereby it might be a ſhadowe for his head and might deliuer him from his griefe. But that afterwarde there is ſayde, that <hi>A worme was prepared,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Note well.</note> here alſo we ſée euen that thoſe things which ſeeme to happen by fortune or chaunce, are not withſtanding gouerned by the ſecret proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God. If any man ſaye that here is ſhewed not what commonly commeth to paſſe, but what was once done: I aunſwere that althoughe God at that tyme would ſet out an example notable and worthy to be remembred, yet is this perpetuallie true, that euen the verie bytinges of wormes are gouerned by the wyl and determination of God. So that neither herbe nor trée without his wyll can wyther, euen as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſayth. That two Sparowes lyght not on the ground without the decrée of the Father. And thus much as touching the worme.</p>
                        <p>Nowe where as there is afterwarde added, that: <hi>VVhen the Sunne aroſe the next daie, a winde was prepared:</hi> hereby alſo we gather that the windes doo not aryſe of their owne accord, or by chaunce, but are rayſed vp by God. There are in déede
<pb facs="tcp:10157:77"/>
cauſes in Nature founde out, why ſometyme the ayer is calme and ſometyme is troubled with windes: but all theſe midle cauſes doeth the counſayle and wiſdome of God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne, ſo that, that is alwayes true, that Nature is not ſome certaine blinde motion and yet there is alwayes a lawe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed thereto by the will of God. God therefore gouerneth by his wiſdome and hande whatſoeuer commeth to paſſe. This onely is the difference:<note place="margin">Note.</note> that thoſe his workes that keepe their common courſe haue the name of Nature: but his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, when as God chaungeth the accuſtomed courſe, doo not keepe ſtill the name of nature: but yet doo come from God himſelfe being the author thereof. Therfore as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this wind this is to be noted that this was not an vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon winde: and yet the common windes are no leſſe rayſed dayly by the prouidence of God, then this winde now blowed wherof <hi>Ionas</hi> here ſpeaketh: but God as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wrought otherwiſe then by the accuſtomed courſe of nature as they ſaye: and yet dayly he commonly kéepeth a continual tenor or rule in the order of nature. Now muſt we ſée why all this diſcourſe is ſet downe. <hi>Ionas</hi> confeſſeth that be greatly reiyoced, when he was couered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the extreame heate of the ſunne. And when the herbe was dead and withered, he was ſtriken with ſo greate dolour, that he deſired to dye. Here is nothing ſuperfluouſe, for <hi>Ionas</hi> both in his ioye and in his ſorrowe ſheweth how tender and prone he is to eyther part, he confeſſeth his delicacie and tenderneſſe, when he ſayth that he was excéedingly gladde: and againe, when he ſayth that he tooke ſuch great ſorrowe for the deade herbe, that in the lothing of his lyfe he deſired death. There is ſecretly here included a free confeſſion of his infirmity: becauſe <hi>Ionas</hi> might more ſimply haue ſet downe and noted his ioye then his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe. But he playnely expreſſed his vehemencie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in eyther affection, that we might know that hée was carried away with his paſſions, ſo that in the ſmalleſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he was to angrye, or els being putt vp with ioy, he kept
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:10157:77"/>
in that alſo no meaſure and thus muche both of his ioye and ſorrowe.</p>
                        <p>Nowe in that he ſayth, that he prayed, as he ſayde a little-before, he onelie vſeth that Hebrew word, which ſignifieth to wiſh. <hi>He wished</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>in his harte that he might die.</hi> It is therefore credyble that <hi>Ionas</hi> was ſo ouerwhelmed with ſorrowe, that he lyfted not vp his mynd any more vnto God: and that we ſée that he was not forſaken and vncared for of God. Now by and by it followeth.</p>

He is not ignoraunt that it is God that ſpeaketh. Why is he not immediatlie ſtroken with feare? why is he not moued with the authoritie of him that ſpeaketh? by and by to laye downe that crueltie of minde?</p>
                        <p>But certainelie, euen thus is it wont to be, when the mindes of men are once blinded with ſome prepoſterous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: although the Lorde thunder or lyghten from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, they wyll not heare: at leaſt, they wyll not ceaſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentlie to runne on, euen as here <hi>Ionas</hi> doth. When as we ſée therfore an example of ſuch contumacie in ſo holy a man, howe much more ought eache of vs to feare? let vs therefore betymes learne to kéepe in and quenche our affections, and at the verie beginning to brydle them, leaſt if it ſhall come to paſſe, that they burſt out any long whyle, we be alſo at the length, euen to the laſt howre obſtinate &amp; vnreformeable.

Nowe therefore we knowe the reaſon of this ſimilitude or figure: <hi>Thou ſaith God, wilt pittie the Gourde, and should not I pittie this great Citie?</hi> By this appeareth, how fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous that deuiſe of <hi>Hierom,</hi> is, when he ſayth, that <hi>Ionas</hi> was not angrie for the delyuerie of the Citie, but for that he perceyued his owne nation (by the conuerſion of the <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uits</hi>) to periſh.</p>
                        <p>For the Lorde here againe repeateth that the minde of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> was otherwyſe: euen that he tooke it gréeuouſlie that the Citie ſhoulde be delyuered from deſtruction. And it is the leſſe tollerable, that this <hi>Hierom</hi> excuſeth <hi>Ionas,</hi> for that <hi>Ionas</hi> flatlie and bouldlie maketh aunſwere vnto GOD, that he doth not offende, in <hi>being angrie euen vnto the death,</hi> That fellowe ſurely dare without any ſhame, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all this, caſt a colour, that he maye excuſe ſuch a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full contumacie. But let it ſuffice vs to holde and knowe the naturall and true ſenſe or meaning of the Prophet. For here vnder the perſon of God, he declareth that his crueltie worthely is condempned, in that ſo deſyrouſlie he wyſhed the the deſtruction of that populous Citie. The partes of the ſimilitude are alſo to be marked, when as he ſayth: <hi>Thou haſt pittied,</hi> there is in the pronoune <hi>Tu, <hi>Thou, an Emphata,</hi>
                           </hi> or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie. For God compareth him ſelfe with <hi>Ionas,</hi> as thus: <hi>VVho art thou?</hi> Certainelie a mortall man ſhall not be ſo prone to mercie and pittie, as I am. Thou permitteſt to thy ſelfe this lawe, that thou wylt néedes pitie the Gourde, euen thou which art framed of claye wylt doo this. Nowe this Gourde (ſayth he) is not thy workmanſhippe, <hi>Thou hast not laboured for it,</hi> that is, it came not forth by thy tyllage or labour: againe, <hi>Thou madest it not to growe,</hi> or, <hi>thou broughteſt it not out of the earth:</hi> Thirdlie: <hi>It was the daughter of one night, and in one night it perished.</hi> It was but a ſmal wythered plant or herbe. Therfore if thou reſpect the nature of the <hi>Gourde,</hi>
                           <pb facs="tcp:10157:80"/>
or if thou reſpect thy ſelfe, and addeſt together all other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtaunces, there is no cauſe for thée to be angrie. And nowe I which am <hi>God,</hi> in whoſe hande are al things, ſhould not I pittie ſayth he? I whoſe continuall propertie it is, mercifullie to beare with men, and to ſuffer them, though they be worthy of deſtruction, ſhoulde not I pittie? againe this is a great Citie. For here is nowe no dealing about a plant, but about a wonderfull great people.</p>
                        <p>Laſtlie, <hi>In which there are</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>120000 <hi>perſons which cannot diſcerne betwixt their right hande, and their lefte hande.</hi>
                           </hi> Well: nowe we ſée howe Emphaticall euerie of the partes of this compariſon bée. But although the purpoſe of God was to reprehende the fooliſh and peruerſe ſorrowe of <hi>Ionas,</hi> yet here maye we gather a generall doctrine, if we reaſon thus: we are ſory one for another and yet we are wicked perſons and cruel: if therefore by a certaine ſecret inſtincte mortall men be thus prone vnto pittye, what is not to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for from the incomprehenſible goodneſſe of God, who both is our Father, and the maker of the whole worlde, and who is the fountaine of goodneſſe and mercye, ſhould not he pittie vs? Now as touching the number. Here <hi>Ionas</hi> ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe twelue tymes ten thouſand perſons which are a hundred and twenty thouſande, as we haue alredye ſayde. Here God ſheweth howe fatherly he taketh care for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde. Euerie one of vs is nouriſhed vp of him with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular care: but yet here he ſetteth before vs that great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that it maye more euidently appeare, that he hath ſo great conſideration of mankinde, that raſhelye he thunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not out his vengaunce againſt any one people. And where he addeth, that they could not diſcerne betweene the right hand and the left, I doubte not but that it is referred to the ſmall age of the perſons, which opinion is alſo almoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued by the conſent of all men. Notwithſtanding one man was afrayde leaſt he ſhould make the Citye to great if he ſhoulde make all that number to be Infants: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10157:80"/>
he comprehendeth in that number, one with another, as well oulde men, as men of myddle age and Infants. He ſayth that they could not diſcerne betweene the right hande and their left, becauſe they were not inſtructed in the ſchoole of God, neyther perceiued they the difference betwéene good and badde: as we know that vnbeléeuers doo wander in their owne errours. But this ſence is to much racked, againe there is no reaſon for this deuiſe: becauſe we know that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie not onely to be lyke other great Cities, as are manye at this daye in <hi>Europe,</hi> but alſo to haue ſurpaſſed euen thoſe which at this daye are moſt principall. We knowe that in <hi>Paris</hi> are more then <hi>400.</hi> thouſande ſoules, the lyke is in other Cities. Therefore that Inuention, that <hi>Ionas</hi> here ſpeaketh of al the <hi>Nineuits,</hi> I doo refuſe. For rather would God declare that although moſt iuſt cauſe were there, why he ſhould vtterly deſtroye that Citie, yet were there other cauſes, which might mittigate ſo horrible puniſhment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there were as then there manye Infants, which had not yet by their owne offences deſerued ſuch deſtruction.</p>
                        <p>God therefore here declareth vnto <hi>Ionas,</hi> howe cruellie he was caried awaye with his zeale: although that zeale, as was ſayde, roſe vpon a good beginning, yet was <hi>Ionas</hi> caryed away with to violent a motion. This God declareth, when as yet he ſpared ſo many innocent Infauntes. He alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the Infants, brute beaſts: Certaynely Oxen excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and were better then plants. If <hi>Ionas</hi> therefore wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely ſorrowed for one ſmall plant being withered: certainly it were farre more hard and cruell, for ſo many innocente creatures to periſhe. Therefore we ſée how fitly al things agrée to the ſimilitude, that <hi>Ionas</hi> may be aſhamed and grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at his foolyſhneſſe, that he woulde ſeeme ſo to runne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſecrete determination of God, and gouerne him ſelfe after a ſort by his owne wyl, not to ſpare the <hi>Nineuits,</hi> when as notwithſtanding they endeuored to preuent Gods
